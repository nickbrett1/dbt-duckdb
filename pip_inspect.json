        "description": ".. This file is included into docs/history.rst\n\n\nGreenlets are lightweight coroutines for in-process concurrent\nprogramming.\n\nThe \"greenlet\" package is a spin-off of `Stackless`_, a version of\nCPython that supports micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run\npseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or a few OS-level threads)\nand are synchronized with data exchanges on \"channels\".\n\nA \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still more primitive notion of\nmicro-thread with no implicit scheduling; coroutines, in other words.\nThis is useful when you want to control exactly when your code runs.\nYou can build custom scheduled micro-threads on top of greenlet;\nhowever, it seems that greenlets are useful on their own as a way to\nmake advanced control flow structures. For example, we can recreate\ngenerators; the difference with Python's own generators is that our\ngenerators can call nested functions and the nested functions can\nyield values too. (Additionally, you don't need a \"yield\" keyword. See\nthe example in `test_generator.py\n<https://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet/blob/adca19bf1f287b3395896a8f41f3f4fd1797fdc7/src/greenlet/tests/test_generator.py#L1>`_).\n\nGreenlets are provided as a C extension module for the regular unmodified\ninterpreter.\n\n.. _`Stackless`: http://www.stackless.com\n\n\nWho is using Greenlet?\n======================\n\nThere are several libraries that use Greenlet as a more flexible\nalternative to Python's built in coroutine support:\n\n - `Concurrence`_\n - `Eventlet`_\n - `Gevent`_\n\n.. _Concurrence: http://opensource.hyves.org/concurrence/\n.. _Eventlet: http://eventlet.net/\n.. _Gevent: http://www.gevent.org/\n\nGetting Greenlet\n================\n\nThe easiest way to get Greenlet is to install it with pip::\n\n  pip install greenlet\n\n\nSource code archives and binary distributions are available on the\npython package index at https://pypi.org/project/greenlet\n\nThe source code repository is hosted on github:\nhttps://github.com/python-greenlet/greenlet\n\nDocumentation is available on readthedocs.org:\nhttps://greenlet.readthedocs.io\n",

For example,\n  `typing.TypeGuard` is new in Python 3.10, but `typing_extensions` allows\n  users on previous Python versions to use it too.\n- Enable experimentation with new type system PEPs before they are accepted and\n  added to the `typing` module.\n\n`typing_extensions` is treated specially by static type checkers such as\nmypy and pyright. Objects defined in `typing_extensions` are treated the same\nway as equivalent forms in `typing`.\n\n`typing_extensions` uses\n[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The\nmajor version will be incremented only for backwards-incompatible changes.\nTherefore, it's safe to depend\non `typing_extensions` like this: `typing_extensions ~=x.y`,\nwhere `x.y` is the first version that includes all features you need.\n[This](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#compatible-release)\nis equivalent to `typing_extensions >=x.y, <(x+1)`. Do not depend on `~= x.y.z`\nunless you really know what you're doing; that defeats the purpose of\nsemantic versioning.\n\n## Included items\n\nSee [the documentation](https://typing-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) for a\ncomplete listing of module contents.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/python/typing_extensions/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor how to contribute to `typing_extensions`.\n\n",

Then the template is passed data to render the final document.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   Template inheritance and inclusion.\n-   Define and import macros within templates.\n-   HTML templates can use autoescaping to prevent XSS from untrusted\n    user input.\n-   A sandboxed environment can safely render untrusted templates.\n-   AsyncIO support for generating templates and calling async\n    functions.\n-   I18N support with Babel.\n-   Templates are compiled to optimized Python code just-in-time and\n    cached, or can be compiled ahead-of-time.\n-   Exceptions point to the correct line in templates to make debugging\n    easier.\n-   Extensible filters, tests, functions, and even syntax.\n\nJinja's philosophy is that while application logic belongs in Python if\npossible, it shouldn't make the template designer's job difficult by\nrestricting functionality too much.\n\n\n## In A Nutshell\n\n```jinja\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n{% block title %}Members{% endblock %}\n{% block content %}\n  <ul>\n  {% for user in users %}\n    <li><a href=\"{{ user.url }}\">{{ user.username }}</a></li>\n  {% endfor %}\n  </ul>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Jinja and other popular\npackages.

Thank you! :dancers:\n\n# Local dev\n\n1. Clone the repo\n2. Switch to the dev branch\n3. Create your own branch\n4. Install dependencies\n\n    - Method 1: Use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to install the dependencies:  `uv sync --all-extras`.\n    - Method 2: Use pip: `pip install -e \".[cli,coverage,dev,docs,static,test]\"`\n5. Build `flit build`\n\n# Contribute\n\n1. Please make your PR against the dev branch\n2. Please make sure that your PR has tests. Since DeepDiff is used in many sensitive data driven projects, we strive to maintain around 100% test coverage on the code.\n\nPlease run `pytest --cov=deepdiff --runslow` to see the coverage report. Note that the `--runslow` flag will run some slow tests too. In most cases you only want to run the fast tests which so you wont add the `--runslow` flag.\n\nOr to see a more user friendly version, please run: `pytest --cov=deepdiff --cov-report term-missing --runslow`.\n\nThank you!\n\n# Authors\n\nPlease take a look at the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS.md) file.\n\n",

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\ndoing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\nthe broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\nanalysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\nits way towards this goal.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Main Features](#main-features)\n- [Where to get it](#where-to-get-it)\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Installation from sources](#installation-from-sources)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n- [Discussion and Development](#discussion-and-development)\n- [Contributing to pandas](#contributing-to-pandas)\n\n## Main Features\nHere are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n\n  - Easy handling of [**missing data**][missing-data] (represented as\n    `NaN`, `NA`, or `NaT`) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n  - Size mutability: columns can be [**inserted and\n    deleted**][insertion-deletion] from DataFrame and higher dimensional\n    objects\n  - Automatic and explicit [**data alignment**][alignment]: objects can\n    be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply\n    ignore the labels and let `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically\n    align the data for you in computations\n  - Powerful, flexible [**group by**][groupby] functionality to perform\n    split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating\n    and transforming data\n  - Make it [**easy to convert**][conversion] ragged,\n    differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures\n    into DataFrame objects\n  - Intelligent label-based [**slicing**][slicing], [**fancy\n    indexing**][fancy-indexing], and [**subsetting**][subsetting] of\n    large data sets\n  - Intuitive [**merging**][merging] and [**joining**][joining] data\n    sets\n  - Flexible [**reshaping**][reshape] and [**pivoting**][pivot-table] of\n    data sets\n  - [**Hierarchical**][mi] labeling of axes (possible to have multiple\n    labels per tick)\n  - Robust IO tools for loading data from [**flat files**][flat-files]\n    (CSV and delimited), [**Excel files**][excel], [**databases**][db],\n    and saving/loading data from the ultrafast [**HDF5 format**][hdfstore]\n  - [**Time series**][timeseries]-specific functionality: date range\n    generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics,\n    date shifting and lagging\n\n\n   [missing-data]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html\n   [insertion-deletion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion\n   [alignment]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html?highlight=alignment#intro-to-data-structures\n   [groupby]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#group-by-split-apply-combine\n   [conversion]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe\n   [slicing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#slicing-ranges\n   [fancy-indexing]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/advanced.html#advanced\n   [subsetting]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing\n   [merging]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-or-named-series-joining-merging\n   [joining]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html#joining-on-index\n   [reshape]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [pivot-table]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html\n   [mi]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#hierarchical-indexing-multiindex\n   [flat-files]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#csv-text-files\n   [excel]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#excel-files\n   [db]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#sql-queries\n   [hdfstore]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#hdf5-pytables\n   [timeseries]: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-series-date-functionality\n\n## Where to get it\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at:\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) and on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n\n```sh\n# conda\nconda install -c conda-forge pandas\n```\n\n```sh\n# or PyPI\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThe list of changes to pandas between each release can be found\n[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew/index.html).

The\n included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in\n the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.\n\n Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is\n Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or\n Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or\n Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or\n Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or\n Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier or\n Copyright © 2017-2018 Arm Limited\n and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All\n have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.\n\n The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy.S) is Copyright © 2008\n The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD\n license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.\n\n The AArch64 memcpy and memset code (src/string/aarch64/*) are\n Copyright © 1999-2019, Arm Limited.\n\n The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is\n Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.\n\n The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was\n originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public\n domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use\n in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.\n\n The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011\n Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.\n\n The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under\n the standard MIT terms.\n\n The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard\n Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted\n by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream\n integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.\n\n The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is\n licensed under the standard MIT terms.\n\n The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,\n and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed\n under the standard MIT terms.\n\n All other files which have no copyright comments are original works\n produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either\n by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more\n contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files\n can be found in the git version control history of the project. The\n omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the\n interest of source tree size.\n\n In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files\n (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into\n applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit\n the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the\n license, and to use these files without any requirement of\n attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:\n\n Bobby Bingham\n John Spencer\n Nicholas J. Kain\n Rich Felker\n Richard Pennington\n Stefan Kristiansson\n Szabolcs Nagy\n\n all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.\n\n This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of\n the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not\n to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it\n negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of\n permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an\n obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.Copyright (c) 2005-2023, NumPy Developers.\n All rights reserved.\n\n Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are\n met:\n\n     * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n        notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n     * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n        copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n        disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided\n        with the distribution.\n\n     * Neither the name of the NumPy Developers nor the names of any\n        contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived\n        from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\n THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\n A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n ==========================\n\n Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\n Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\n as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\n principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\n In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\n National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\n in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\n software.\n\n In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\n BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\n year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\n Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\n https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\n created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\n Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\n All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\n the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\n releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\n the various releases.\n\n     Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                     from                                compatible? (1)\n\n     0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n     1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n     1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n     2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n     1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n     2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n     2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n     2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n     2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n     2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n     2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\n Footnotes:\n\n (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n     is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\n Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\n direction to make these releases possible.\n\n\n B. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON\n ===============================================================\n\n Python software and documentation are licensed under the\n Python Software Foundation License Version 2.\n\n Starting with Python 3.8.6, examples, recipes, and other code in\n the documentation are dual licensed under the PSF License Version 2\n and the Zero-Clause BSD license.\n\n Some software incorporated into Python is under different licenses.\n The licenses are listed with code falling under that license.\n\n\n PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2\n --------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

PyICU depends on icu4c which on macOS requires homebrew::\n\n    brew install icu4c\n\nThe Makefile contains the macOS default values for them so you may need to tweak them.\n\n===================\nUsing parsedatetime\n===================\n\nAn example of how to use parsedatetime:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import parsedatetime\n\n    cal = parsedatetime.Calendar()\n\n    cal.parse(\"tomorrow\")\n\nTo get it to a Python ``datetime`` object:\n\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from datetime import datetime\n\n    time_struct, parse_status = cal.parse(\"tomorrow\")\n\n    datetime(*time_struct[:6])\n\nParse datetime with timezone support (using pytz package):\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import parsedatetime\n    import pytz\n    from pytz import timezone\n\n    cal = parsedatetime.Calendar()\n\n    datetime_obj, _ = cal.parseDT(datetimeString=\"tomorrow\", tzinfo=timezone(\"US/Pacific\"))\n\nMore detailed examples can be found in the examples directory.\n\n=============\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe generated documentation is included by default in the docs directory and can also be viewed online at https://bear.im/code/parsedatetime/docs/index.html\n\nThe docs can be generated by running::\n\n    make docs\n\n=====\nNotes\n=====\n\nThe ``Calendar`` class has a member property named ``ptc`` which is created during the class init method to be an instance\nof ``parsedatetime_consts.CalendarConstants()``.\n\n=======\nHistory\n=======\n\nThe code in parsedatetime has been implemented over the years in many different languages (C, Clipper, Delphi) as part of different custom/proprietary systems I've worked on.  Sadly the previous code is not \"open\" in any sense of that word.\n\nWhen I went to work for Open Source Applications Foundation and realized that the Chandler project could benefit from my experience with parsing of date/time text I decided to start from scratch and implement the code using Python and make it truly open.\n\nAfter working on the initial concept and creating something that could be shown to the Chandler folks, the code has now evolved to its current state with the help of the Chandler folks, most especially Darshana.\n\n\n",

        "description": "# Orderly Set 5.5.0\n\nOrderly Set is a package containing multiple implementations of Ordered Set.\n\n\n## OrderlySet\n\nThis implementation keeps the order in all set operations except set difference operations.\nAs a result, it can do set difference operations much faster than other implementations. Still 2X slower than of Python's built-in set.\n\n\n## StableSet\n\nA StableSet is a mutable set that remembers its insertion order.\nFeaturing: Fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing.\nBut slow O(N) Index Lookup.\n\n## StableSetEq\n\nSame as StableSet but the order of items doesn't matter for equality comparisons.\n\n## OrderedSet\n\nAn OrderedSet is a mutable data structure that is a hybrid of a list and a set.\nIt remembers its insertion order so that every entry has an index that can be looked up. \nFeaturing: O(1) Index lookup, insertion, iteration and membership testing.\nBut slow O(N) Deletion.\n\n\n## SortedSet\n\nSortedSet is basically set but when printed, turned into string, or iterated over, returns the items in alphabetical order.\n\n# Installation\n\n`pip install orderly-set`\n\n# Usage examples\n\nAn OrderedSet is created and used like a set:\n\n    >>> from orderly_set import OrderedSet\n\n    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')\n\n    >>> letters\n    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd'])\n\n    >>> 'r' in letters\n    True\n\nIt is efficient to find the index of an entry in an OrderedSet, or find an\nentry by its index. To help with this use case, the `.add()` method returns\nthe index of the added item, whether it was already in the set or not.\n\n    >>> letters.index('r')\n    2\n\n    >>> letters[2]\n    'r'\n\n    >>> letters.add('r')\n    2\n\n    >>> letters.add('x')\n    5\n\nOrderedSets implement the union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`)\noperators like sets do.\n\n    >>> letters |= OrderedSet('shazam')\n\n    >>> letters\n    OrderedSet(['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])\n\n    >>> letters & set('aeiou')\n    OrderedSet(['a'])\n\n    >>> letters -= 'abcd'\n\n    >>> letters\n    OrderedSet(['r', 'x', 's', 'h', 'z', 'm'])\n\nThe `__getitem__()` method has been extended to accept any\niterable except a string, returning a list, to perform NumPy-like \"fancy\nindexing\".\n\n    >>> letters = OrderedSet('abracadabra')\n\n    >>> letters[[0, 2, 3]]\n    ['a', 'r', 'c']\n\n    >>> letters.indexes(['a', 'r', 'c'])\n    [0, 2, 3]\n\nOrderedSet implements `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` so it can be pickled,\nand implements the abstract base classes `collections.MutableSet` and\n`collections.Sequence`.\n\nOrderedSet can be used as a generic collection type, similar to the collections\nin the `typing` module like List, Dict, and Set. For example, you can annotate\na variable as having the type `OrderedSet[str]` or `OrderedSet[Tuple[int,\nstr]]`.\n\n\n# Authors\n\nPlease check the [Authors](AUTHORS.md) file.\n\n# Comparisons\n\n```\n-- initialize a set --\nUsing Python dict time: 4.13\nset time: 2.98\nordered_set.OrderedSet time: 15.77\norderly_set.OrderedSet time: 15.25\nStableSet time: 4.78\nOrderlySet time: 4.38\nSortedSet time: 3.09\n\n-- update a set --\nUsing Python dict: 6.77\nset time: 2.46\nordered_set.OrderedSet time: 10.17\norderly_set.OrderedSet time: 10.06\nStableSet time: 7.16\nOrderlySet time: 6.77\nSortedSet time: 2.46\n\n-- update a set and get item --\nordered_set.OrderedSet time: 29.98\norderly_set.OrderedSet time: 29.57\nStableSet time: 14.31\nOrderlySet time: 14.23\nSortedSet time: 9.03\n\n-- set symmetric difference (xor) --\nset time: 5.368663903005654\nordered_set.OrderedSet time: 39.25\norderly_set.OrderedSet time: 80.31\nStableSet time: 42.81\nOrderlySet time: 11.44\nSortedSet time: 3.87\n\n-- set difference (-) --\nset time: 3.7398674299911363\nordered_set.OrderedSet time: 22.39\norderly_set.OrderedSet time: 38.00\nStableSet time: 22.30\nOrderlySet time: 8.92\nSortedSet time: 3.03\n```\n\nDespite what you see in the benchmarks, in DeepDiff OrderlySet performed better than SortedSet.\n\n\nA StableSet is a mutable set that remembers its insertion order.\nFeaturing: Fast O(1) insertion, deletion, iteration and membership testing.\nBut slow O(N) Index Lookup.\n\nAn OrderedSet is a mutable data structure that is a hybrid of a list and a set.\nIt remembers its insertion order so that every entry has an index that can be looked up. \nFeaturing: O(1) Index lookup, insertion, iteration and membership testing.\nBut slow O(N) Deletion.\n\nBoth have similar interfaces but differ in respect of their implementation and performance.\n\nThe original implementation of OrderedSet was a [recipe posted to ActiveState\nRecipes][recipe] by Raymond Hettiger, released under the MIT license.\n\n[recipe]: https://code.activestate.com/recipes/576694-orderedset/\n\nHettiger's implementation kept its content in a doubly-linked list referenced by a\ndict. As a result, looking up an item by its index was an O(N) operation, while\ndeletion was O(1).\n\nThis version of OrderedSet makes different trade-offs for the sake of efficient lookups. \nIts content is a standard Python list instead of a doubly-linked list. This\nprovides O(1) lookups by index at the expense of O(N) deletion, as well as\nslightly faster iteration.\n\n",

(Tested on Linux.) You can install this with `cargo install flamegraph`.\n\nRun `make build-profiling` to install a release build with debugging symbols included (needed for profiling).\n\nOnce that is built, you can profile pytest benchmarks with (e.g.):\n\n```bash\nflamegraph -- pytest tests/benchmarks/test_micro_benchmarks.py -k test_list_of_ints_core_py --benchmark-enable\n```\nThe `flamegraph` command will produce an interactive SVG at `flamegraph.svg`.\n\n## Releasing\n\n1. Bump package version locally. Do not just edit `Cargo.toml` on Github, you need both `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to be updated.\n2. Make a PR for the version bump and merge it.\n3. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/releases and click \"Draft a new release\"\n4. In the \"Choose a tag\" dropdown enter the new tag `v<the.new.version>` and select \"Create new tag on publish\" when the option appears.\n5. Enter the release title in the form \"v<the.new.version> <YYYY-MM-DD>\"\n6. Click Generate release notes button\n7. Click Publish release\n8. Go to https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/actions and ensure that all build for release are done successfully.\n9. Go to https://pypi.org/project/pydantic-core/ and ensure that the latest release is published.\n10. Done 🎉\n\n",

        "description": "pytz - World Timezone Definitions for Python\n============================================\n\n:Author: Stuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n\nIntroduction\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\npytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows\naccurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4\nor higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end\nof daylight saving time, which you can read more about in the Python\nLibrary Reference (``datetime.tzinfo``).\n\nAlmost all of the Olson timezones are supported.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support\n    now included as part of the standard library, and third party\n    packages work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n    pytz offers no advantages beyond backwards compatibility with\n    code written for earlier versions of Python.\n\n.. note::\n\n    This library differs from the documented Python API for\n    tzinfo implementations; if you want to create local wallclock\n    times you need to use the ``localize()`` method documented in this\n    document. In addition, if you perform date arithmetic on local\n    times that cross DST boundaries, the result may be in an incorrect\n    timezone (ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002-10-27 1:00 EST and you get\n    2002-10-27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002-10-27 1:59 EDT). A\n    ``normalize()`` method is provided to correct this. Unfortunately these\n    issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime\n    implementation (see PEP-431).\n\n\nInstallation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package can either be installed using ``pip`` or from a tarball using the\nstandard Python distutils.\n\nIf you are installing using ``pip``, you don't need to download anything as the\nlatest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI::\n\n    pip install pytz\n\nIf you are installing from a tarball, run the following command as an\nadministrative user::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\n\npytz for Enterprise\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use. `Learn more. <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytz?utm_source=pypi-pytz&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo>`_.\n\n\nExample & Usage\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLocalized times and date arithmetic\n-----------------------------------\n\n>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n>>> from pytz import timezone\n>>> import pytz\n>>> utc = pytz.utc\n>>> utc.zone\n'UTC'\n>>> eastern = timezone('US/Eastern')\n>>> eastern.zone\n'US/Eastern'\n>>> amsterdam = timezone('Europe/Amsterdam')\n>>> fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z%z'\n\nThis library only supports two ways of building a localized time. The\nfirst is to use the ``localize()`` method provided by the pytz library.\nThis is used to localize a naive datetime (datetime with no timezone\ninformation):\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0))\n>>> print(loc_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 06:00:00 EST-0500\n\nThe second way of building a localized time is by converting an existing\nlocalized time using the standard ``astimezone()`` method:\n\n>>> ams_dt = loc_dt.astimezone(amsterdam)\n>>> ams_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 CET+0100'\n\nUnfortunately using the tzinfo argument of the standard datetime\nconstructors ''does not work'' with pytz for many timezones.\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=amsterdam).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Does not work this way!\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 LMT+0018'\n\nIt is safe for timezones without daylight saving transitions though, such\nas UTC:\n\n>>> datetime(2002, 10, 27, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc).strftime(fmt)  # /!\\ Not recommended except for UTC\n'2002-10-27 12:00:00 UTC+0000'\n\nThe preferred way of dealing with times is to always work in UTC,\nconverting to localtime only when generating output to be read\nby humans.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 6, 0, 0, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> loc_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(eastern)\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:00:00 EST-0500'\n\nThis library also allows you to do date arithmetic using local\ntimes, although it is more complicated than working in UTC as you\nneed to use the ``normalize()`` method to handle daylight saving time\nand other timezone transitions. In this example, ``loc_dt`` is set\nto the instant when daylight saving time ends in the US/Eastern\ntimezone.\n\n>>> before = loc_dt - timedelta(minutes=10)\n>>> before.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 00:50:00 EST-0500'\n>>> eastern.normalize(before).strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:50:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> after = eastern.normalize(before + timedelta(minutes=20))\n>>> after.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:10:00 EST-0500'\n\nCreating local times is also tricky, and the reason why working with\nlocal times is not recommended. Unfortunately, you cannot just pass\na ``tzinfo`` argument when constructing a datetime (see the next\nsection for more details)\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 0)\n>>> dt1 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400'\n>>> dt2 = eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nConverting between timezones is more easily done, using the\nstandard astimezone method.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz)\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> utc_dt == utc_dt2\nTrue\n\nYou can take shortcuts when dealing with the UTC side of timezone\nconversions. ``normalize()`` and ``localize()`` are not really\nnecessary when there are no daylight saving time transitions to\ndeal with.\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(1143408899, tz=utc)\n>>> utc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n>>> au_tz = timezone('Australia/Sydney')\n>>> au_dt = au_tz.normalize(utc_dt.astimezone(au_tz))\n>>> au_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-27 08:34:59 AEDT+1100'\n>>> utc_dt2 = au_dt.astimezone(utc)\n>>> utc_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'2006-03-26 21:34:59 UTC+0000'\n\n\n``tzinfo`` API\n--------------\n\nThe ``tzinfo`` instances returned by the ``timezone()`` function have\nbeen extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an ``is_dst``\nparameter to the ``utcoffset()``, ``dst()`` && ``tzname()`` methods.\n\n>>> tz = timezone('America/St_Johns')\n\n>>> normal = datetime(2009, 9, 1)\n>>> ambiguous = datetime(2009, 10, 31, 23, 30)\n\nThe ``is_dst`` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used\nduring DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=True))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=True)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(normal, is_dst=False).seconds\n3600\n>>> tz.tzname(normal, is_dst=False)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(ambiguous, is_dst=False))\n-1 day, 20:30:00\n>>> tz.dst(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\ndatetime.timedelta(0)\n>>> tz.tzname(ambiguous, is_dst=False)\n'NST'\n\nIf ``is_dst`` is not specified, ambiguous timestamps will raise\nan ``pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError`` exception.\n\n>>> print(tz.utcoffset(normal))\n-1 day, 21:30:00\n>>> print(tz.dst(normal))\n1:00:00\n>>> tz.tzname(normal)\n'NDT'\n\n>>> import pytz.exceptions\n>>> try:\n...     tz.utcoffset(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.dst(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n>>> try:\n...     tz.tzname(ambiguous)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % ambiguous)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2009-10-31 23:30:00\n\n\nProblems with Localtime\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes\nmay occur twice in a year. For example, in the US/Eastern timezone\non the last Sunday morning in October, the following sequence\nhappens:\n\n    - 01:00 EDT occurs\n    - 1 hour later, instead of 2:00am the clock is turned back 1 hour\n      and 01:00 happens again (this time 01:00 EST)\n\nIn fact, every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice. This means\nthat if you try and create a time in the 'US/Eastern' timezone\nthe standard datetime syntax, there is no way to specify if you meant\nbefore of after the end-of-daylight-saving-time transition. Using the\npytz custom syntax, the best you can do is make an educated guess:\n\n>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00))\n>>> loc_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500'\n\nAs you can see, the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50%\nchance of it being out by one hour. For some applications, this does\nnot matter. However, if you are trying to schedule meetings with people\nin different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable.\n\nThe best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC.  The pytz\npackage encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by\nincluding a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python\nreference implementation in the Python documentation.\n\nThe UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance, and pickles to a\nsmaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances.  The UTC implementation\ncan be obtained as pytz.utc, pytz.UTC, or pytz.timezone('UTC').\n\n>>> import pickle, pytz\n>>> dt = datetime(2005, 3, 1, 14, 13, 21, tzinfo=utc)\n>>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None)\n>>> p = pickle.dumps(dt, 1)\n>>> naive_p = pickle.dumps(naive, 1)\n>>> len(p) - len(naive_p)\n17\n>>> new = pickle.loads(p)\n>>> new == dt\nTrue\n>>> new is dt\nFalse\n>>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo\nTrue\n>>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone('UTC')\nTrue\n\nNote that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same (GMT,\nGreenwich, Universal, etc.). The definition of UTC is distinct from these\nother timezones, and they are not equivalent. For this reason, they will\nnot compare the same in Python.\n\n>>> utc == pytz.timezone('GMT')\nFalse\n\nSee the section `What is UTC`_, below.\n\nIf you insist on working with local times, this library provides a\nfacility for constructing them unambiguously:\n\n>>> loc_dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=True)\n>>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt, is_dst=False)\n>>> print(est_dt.strftime(fmt) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime(fmt))\n2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT-0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST-0500\n\nIf you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize(), pytz will refuse to\nguess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent\ntimes.\n\nFor example, 1:30am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US/Eastern\ntimezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving\nTime:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 1, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: 2002-10-27 01:30:00\n\nSimilarly, 2:30am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the\nUS/Eastern timezone, as the clocks where put forward at 2:00am skipping\nthe entire hour:\n\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 4, 7, 2, 30, 00)\n>>> try:\n...     eastern.localize(dt, is_dst=None)\n... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError:\n...     print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: %s' % dt)\npytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError: 2002-04-07 02:30:00\n\nBoth of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling\neasier:\n\n>>> isinstance(pytz.AmbiguousTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n>>> isinstance(pytz.NonExistentTimeError(), pytz.InvalidTimeError)\nTrue\n\n\nA special case is where countries change their timezone definitions\nwith no daylight savings time switch. For example, in 1915 Warsaw\nswitched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings\ntransition. So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks\nwere wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot\nbe specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the\nactual UTC offset. In this case midnight happened twice, neither time\nduring a daylight saving time period. pytz handles this transition by\ntreating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings\ntime, and the ambiguous period after as standard time.\n\n\n>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone('Europe/Warsaw')\n>>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=True)\n>>> amb_dt1.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 WMT+0124'\n>>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 4, 23, 59, 59), is_dst=False)\n>>> amb_dt2.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100'\n>>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime(1915, 8, 5, 00, 00, 00), is_dst=False)\n>>> switch_dt.strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt1)\n'0:24:01'\n>>> str(switch_dt - amb_dt2)\n'0:00:01'\n\nThe best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is\nby converting from another timezone such as UTC:\n\n>>> utc_dt = datetime(1915, 8, 4, 22, 36, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n>>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime(fmt)\n'1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100'\n\nThe standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to\nhandle them, such as demonstrated in this example using the US/Eastern\ntimezone definition from the Python documentation (Note that this\nimplementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is\nincluded for tests only!):\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> dt = datetime(2002, 10, 27, 0, 30, tzinfo=Eastern)\n>>> str(dt)\n'2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=1))\n'2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=2))\n'2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00'\n>>> str(dt + timedelta(hours=3))\n'2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00'\n\nNotice the first two results? At first glance you might think they are\ncorrect, but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are\nactually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for.\n\n>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests\n>>> str(dt.astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00'\n>>> str((dt + timedelta(hours=1)).astimezone(UTC))\n'2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00'\n\n\nCountry Information\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA mechanism is provided to access the timezones commonly in use\nfor a particular country, looked up using the ISO 3166 country code.\nIt returns a list of strings that can be used to retrieve the relevant\ntzinfo instance using ``pytz.timezone()``:\n\n>>> print(' '.join(pytz.country_timezones['nz']))\nPacific/Auckland Pacific/Chatham\n\nThe Olson database comes with a ISO 3166 country code to English country\nname mapping that pytz exposes as a dictionary:\n\n>>> print(pytz.country_names['nz'])\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWhat is UTC\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n'UTC' is `Coordinated Universal Time`_. It is a successor to, but distinct\nfrom, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the various definitions of Universal\nTime. UTC is now the worldwide standard for regulating clocks and time\nmeasurement.\n\nAll other timezones are defined relative to UTC, and include offsets like\nUTC+0800 - hours to add or subtract from UTC to derive the local time. No\ndaylight saving time occurs in UTC, making it a useful timezone to perform\ndate arithmetic without worrying about the confusion and ambiguities caused\nby daylight saving time transitions, your country changing its timezone, or\nmobile computers that roam through multiple timezones.\n\n..  _Coordinated Universal Time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\n\n\nHelpers\n~~~~~~~\n\nThere are two lists of timezones provided.\n\n``all_timezones`` is the exhaustive list of the timezone names that can\nbe used.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones\n>>> len(all_timezones) >= 500\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in all_timezones\nTrue\n\n``common_timezones`` is a list of useful, current timezones. It doesn't\ncontain deprecated zones or historical zones, except for a few I've\ndeemed in common usage, such as US/Eastern (open a bug report if you\nthink other timezones are deserving of being included here). It is also\na sequence of strings.\n\n>>> from pytz import common_timezones\n>>> len(common_timezones) < len(all_timezones)\nTrue\n>>> 'Etc/Greenwich' in common_timezones\nFalse\n>>> 'Australia/Melbourne' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Canada/Eastern' in common_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in all_timezones\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Yancowinna' in common_timezones\nFalse\n\nBoth ``common_timezones`` and ``all_timezones`` are alphabetically\nsorted:\n\n>>> common_timezones_dupe = common_timezones[:]\n>>> common_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> common_timezones == common_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n>>> all_timezones_dupe = all_timezones[:]\n>>> all_timezones_dupe.sort()\n>>> all_timezones == all_timezones_dupe\nTrue\n\n``all_timezones`` and ``common_timezones`` are also available as sets.\n\n>>> from pytz import all_timezones_set, common_timezones_set\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in all_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'US/Eastern' in common_timezones_set\nTrue\n>>> 'Australia/Victoria' in common_timezones_set\nFalse\n\nYou can also retrieve lists of timezones used by particular countries\nusing the ``country_timezones()`` function. It requires an ISO-3166\ntwo letter country code.\n\n>>> from pytz import country_timezones\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('ch')))\nEurope/Zurich\n>>> print(' '.join(country_timezones('CH')))\nEurope/Zurich\n\n\nInternationalization - i18n/l10n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPytz is an interface to the IANA database, which uses ASCII names. The `Unicode  Consortium's Unicode Locales (CLDR) <http://cldr.unicode.org>`_\nproject provides translations. Python packages such as\n`Babel <https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html#timezone-functionality>`_\nand Thomas Khyn's `l18n <https://pypi.org/project/l18n/>`_ package can be used\nto access these translations from Python.\n\n\nLicense\n~~~~~~~\n\nMIT license.\n\nThis code is also available as part of Zope 3 under the Zope Public\nLicense,  Version 2.1 (ZPL).\n\nI'm happy to relicense this code if necessary for inclusion in other\nopen source projects.\n\n\nLatest Versions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis package will be updated after releases of the Olson timezone\ndatabase.  The latest version can be downloaded from the `Python Package\nIndex <https://pypi.org/project/pytz/>`_.  The code that is used\nto generate this distribution is hosted on Github and available\nusing git::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/stub42/pytz.git\n\nAnnouncements of new releases are made on\n`Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/pytz>`_, and the\n`Atom feed <http://feeds.launchpad.net/pytz/announcements.atom>`_\nhosted there.\n\n\nBugs, Feature Requests & Patches\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBugs should be reported on `Github <https://github.com/stub42/pytz/issues>`_.\nFeature requests are unlikely to be considered, and efforts instead directed\nto timezone support now built into Python or packages that work with it.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReports about security issues can be made via `Tidelift <https://tidelift.com/security>`_.\n\n\nIssues & Limitations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- This project is in maintenance mode. Projects using Python 3.9 or later\n  are best served by using the timezone functionaly now included in core\n  Python and packages that work with it such as `tzdata <https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/>`_.\n\n- Offsets from UTC are rounded to the nearest whole minute, so timezones\n  such as Europe/Amsterdam pre 1937 will be up to 30 seconds out. This\n  was a limitation of the Python datetime library.\n\n- If you think a timezone definition is incorrect, I probably can't fix\n  it. pytz is a direct translation of the Olson timezone database, and\n  changes to the timezone definitions need to be made to this source.\n  If you find errors they should be reported to the time zone mailing\n  list, linked from http://www.iana.org/time-zones.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMore info than you want to know about timezones:\nhttps://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html\n\n\nContact\n~~~~~~~\n\nStuart Bishop <stuart@stuartbishop.net>\n",

        "summary": "The duckdb adapter plugin for dbt (data build tool)",
        "description": "## dbt-duckdb\n\n[DuckDB](http://duckdb.org) is an embedded database, similar to SQLite, but designed for OLAP-style analytics.\nIt is crazy fast and allows you to read and write data stored in CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly, without requiring you to load\nthem into the database first.\n\n[dbt](http://getdbt.com) is the best way to manage a collection of data transformations written in SQL or Python for analytics\nand data science. `dbt-duckdb` is the project that ties DuckDB and dbt together, allowing you to create a [Modern Data Stack In\nA Box](https://duckdb.org/2022/10/12/modern-data-stack-in-a-box.html) or a simple and powerful data lakehouse with Python.\n\n### Installation\n\nThis project is hosted on PyPI, so you should be able to install it and the necessary dependencies via:\n\n`pip3 install dbt-duckdb`\n\nThe latest supported version targets `dbt-core` versions >= 1.8.x and `duckdb` version 1.1.x, but we work hard to ensure that newer\nversions of DuckDB will continue to work with the adapter as they are released.\n\n### Configuring Your Profile\n\nA super-minimal dbt-duckdb profile only needs *one* setting:\n\n````\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n  target: dev\n````\n\nThis will run your dbt-duckdb pipeline against an in-memory DuckDB database that will not be persisted after your run completes. This may\nnot seem very useful at first, but it turns out to be a powerful tool for a) testing out data pipelines, either locally or in CI jobs and\nb) running data pipelines that operate purely on external CSV, Parquet, or JSON files. More details on how to work with external data files\nin dbt-duckdb are provided in the docs on [reading and writing external files](#reading-and-writing-external-files).\n\nTo have your dbt pipeline persist relations in a DuckDB file, set the `path` field in your profile to the path\nof the DuckDB file that you would like to read and write on your local filesystem. (For in-memory pipelines, the `path`\nis automatically set to the special value `:memory:`). By default, the `path` is relative to your `profiles.yml` file location.\nIf the database doesn't exist at the specified `path`, DuckDB will automatically create it.\n\n`dbt-duckdb` also supports common profile fields like `schema` and `threads`, but the `database` property is special: its value is automatically set\nto the basename of the file in the `path` argument with the suffix removed. For example, if the `path` is `/tmp/a/dbfile.duckdb`, the `database`\nfield will be set to `dbfile`. If you are running in in-memory mode, then the `database` property will be automatically set to `memory`.\n\n#### Using MotherDuck\n\nAs of `dbt-duckdb` 1.5.2, you can connect to a DuckDB instance running on [MotherDuck](http://www.motherduck.com) by setting your `path` to use a [md:<database> connection string](https://motherduck.com/docs/getting-started/connect-query-from-python/installation-authentication), just as you would with the DuckDB CLI\nor the Python API.\n\nMotherDuck databases generally work the same way as local DuckDB databases from the perspective of dbt, but\nthere are a [few differences to be aware of](https://motherduck.com/docs/architecture-and-capabilities#considerations-and-limitations):\n1. MotherDuck is compatible with client DuckDB versions 0.10.2 and older.\n1. MotherDuck preloads a set of the most common DuckDB extensions for you, but does not support loading custom extensions or user-defined functions.\n\nAs of `dbt-duckdb` 1.9.6, you can also connect to a DuckDB instance running [hosted DuckLake on MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/blog/ducklake-motherduck/) by creating a DuckLake on MotherDuck and then setting `is_ducklake: true` in your `profiles.yml`.\n\n```sql\n-- to use create your own database in MotherDuck first\nCREATE DATABASE my_ducklake\n  (TYPE ducklake, DATA_PATH 's3://...')\n```\n\nAn example profile is show below under \"Attaching Additional Databases\". DuckLake must be identified so that safe DDL operations are applied by dbt.\n\n#### DuckDB Extensions, Settings, and Filesystems\n\nYou can install and load any core [DuckDB extensions](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/overview) by listing them in\nthe `extensions` field in your profile as a string. You can also set any additional [DuckDB configuration options](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/configuration)\nvia the `settings` field, including options that are supported in the loaded extensions. You can also configure extensions from outside of the core\nextension repository (e.g., a community extension) by configuring the extension as a `name`/`repo` pair:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      extensions:\n        - httpfs\n        - parquet\n        - name: h3\n          repo: community\n        - name: uc_catalog\n          repo: core_nightly\n  target: dev\n```\n\nTo use the [DuckDB Secrets Manager](https://duckdb.org/docs/configuration/secrets_manager.html), you can use the `secrets` field. For example, to be able to connect to S3 and read/write\nParquet files using an AWS access key and secret, your profile would look something like this:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      extensions:\n        - httpfs\n        - parquet\n      secrets:\n        - type: s3\n          region: my-aws-region\n          key_id: \"{{ env_var('S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}\"\n          secret: \"{{ env_var('S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}\"\n  target: dev\n```\n\nAs of version `1.4.1`, we have added (experimental!) support for DuckDB's (experimental!) support for filesystems\nimplemented via [fsspec](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/python/filesystems.html). The `fsspec` library provides\nsupport for reading and writing files from a [variety of cloud data storage systems](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#other-known-implementations)\nincluding S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage. You can configure a list of fsspec-compatible implementations for use with your dbt-duckdb project by installing the relevant Python modules\nand configuring your profile like so:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      filesystems:\n        - fs: s3\n          anon: false\n          key: \"{{ env_var('S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID') }}\"\n          secret: \"{{ env_var('S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY') }}\"\n          client_kwargs:\n            endpoint_url: \"http://localhost:4566\"\n  target: dev\n```\n\nHere, the `filesystems` property takes a list of configurations, where each entry must have a property named `fs` that indicates which `fsspec` protocol\nto load (so `s3`, `gcs`, `abfs`, etc.) and then an arbitrary set of other key-value pairs that are used to configure the `fsspec` implementation. You can see a simple example project that\nillustrates the usage of this feature to connect to a Localstack instance running S3 from dbt-duckdb [here](https://github.com/jwills/s3-demo).\n\n#### Fetching credentials from context\n\nInstead of specifying the credentials through the settings block, you can also use the `CREDENTIAL_CHAIN` secret provider. This means that you can use any supported mechanism from AWS to obtain credentials (e.g., web identity tokens). You can read more about the secret providers [here](https://duckdb.org/docs/configuration/secrets_manager.html#secret-providers). To use the `CREDENTIAL_CHAIN` provider and automatically fetch credentials from AWS, specify the `provider` in the `secrets` key:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      extensions:\n        - httpfs\n        - parquet\n      secrets:\n        - type: s3\n          provider: credential_chain\n  target: dev\n```\n\n#### Scoped credentials by storage prefix\n\nSecrets can be scoped, such that different storage path can use different credentials.\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      extensions:\n        - httpfs\n        - parquet\n      secrets:\n        - type: s3\n          provider: credential_chain\n          scope: [ \"s3://bucket-in-eu-region\", \"s3://bucket-2-in-eu-region\" ]\n          region: \"eu-central-1\"\n        - type: s3\n          region: us-west-2\n          scope: \"s3://bucket-in-us-region\"\n```\n\nWhen fetching a secret for a path, the secret scopes are compared to the path, returning the matching secret for the path. In the case of multiple matching secrets, the longest prefix is chosen.\n\n#### Attaching Additional Databases\n\nDuckDB supports [attaching additional databases](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/statements/attach.html) to your dbt-duckdb run so that you can read\nand write from multiple databases. Additional databases may be configured via the `attach` argument\nin your profile that was added in dbt-duckdb `1.4.0`:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      attach:\n        - path: /tmp/other.duckdb\n        - path: ./yet/another.duckdb\n          alias: yet_another\n        - path: s3://yep/even/this/works.duckdb\n          read_only: true\n        - path: sqlite.db\n          type: sqlite\n        - path: postgresql://username@hostname/dbname\n          type: postgres\n        # Using the options dict for arbitrary ATTACH options\n        - path: /tmp/special.duckdb\n          options:\n            cache_size: 1GB\n            threads: 4\n            enable_fsst: true\n```\n\nFor DuckLake, use `ducklake:` for local; for MotherDuck-managed DuckLake use `md:` with `is_ducklake: true`.\n\n```yaml\nattach:\n  - path: \"ducklake:my_ducklake.ddb\"\n  - path: \"md:my_other_ducklake\"\n    is_ducklake: true\n```\n\n\nThe attached databases may be referred to in your dbt sources and models by either the basename of the database file minus its suffix (e.g., `/tmp/other.duckdb` is the `other` database\nand `s3://yep/even/this/works.duckdb` is the `works` database) or by an alias that you specify (so the `./yet/another.duckdb` database in the above configuration is referred to\nas `yet_another` instead of `another`.) Note that these additional databases do not necessarily have to be DuckDB files: DuckDB's storage and catalog engines are pluggable, and\nDuckDB ships with support for reading and writing from attached databases. You can indicate the type of the database you are connecting to via the `type` argument,\nwhich currently supports `duckdb`, `sqlite` and `postgres`.\n\n##### Arbitrary ATTACH Options\n\nAs DuckDB continues to add new attachment options, you can use the `options` dictionary to specify any additional key-value pairs that will be passed to the `ATTACH` statement. This allows you to take advantage of new DuckDB features without waiting for explicit support in dbt-duckdb:\n\n```\nattach:\n  # Standard way using direct fields\n  - path: /tmp/db1.duckdb\n    type: sqlite\n    read_only: true\n\n  # New way using options dict (equivalent to above)\n  - path: /tmp/db2.duckdb\n    options:\n      type: sqlite\n      read_only: true\n\n  # Mix of both (no conflicts allowed)\n  - path: /tmp/db3.duckdb\n    type: sqlite\n    options:\n      block_size: 16384\n\n  # Using options dict for future DuckDB attachment options\n  - path: /tmp/db4.duckdb\n    options:\n      type: duckdb\n      # Example: hypothetical future options DuckDB might add\n      compression: lz4\n      memory_limit: 2GB\n```\n\nNote: If you specify the same option in both a direct field (`type`, `secret`, `read_only`) and in the `options` dict, dbt-duckdb will raise an error to prevent conflicts.\n\n#### Configuring dbt-duckdb Plugins\n\ndbt-duckdb has its own [plugin](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/__init__.py) system to enable advanced users to extend\ndbt-duckdb with additional functionality, including:\n\n* Defining [custom Python UDFs](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/function.html) on the DuckDB database connection\nso that they can be used in your SQL models\n* Loading source data from [Excel](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/excel.py), [Google Sheets](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/gsheet.py), or [SQLAlchemy](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/sqlalchemy.py) tables\n\nYou can find more details on [how to write your own plugins here](#writing-your-own-plugins). To configure a plugin for use\nin your dbt project, use the `plugins` property on the profile:\n\n```\ndefault:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      type: duckdb\n      path: /tmp/dbt.duckdb\n      plugins:\n        - module: gsheet\n          config:\n            method: oauth\n        - module: sqlalchemy\n          alias: sql\n          config:\n            connection_url: \"{{ env_var('DBT_ENV_SECRET_SQLALCHEMY_URI') }}\"\n        - module: path.to.custom_udf_module\n```\n\nEvery plugin must have a `module` property that indicates where the `Plugin` class to load is defined. There is\na set of built-in plugins that are defined in [dbt.adapters.duckdb.plugins](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/) that\nmay be referenced by their base filename (e.g., `excel` or `gsheet`), while user-defined plugins (which are\ndescribed later in this document) should be referred to via their full module path name (e.g. a `lib.my.custom` module that defines a class named `Plugin`.)\n\nEach plugin instance has a name for logging and reference purposes that defaults to the name of the module\nbut that may be overridden by the user by setting the `alias` property in the configuration. Finally,\nmodules may be initialized using an arbitrary set of key-value pairs that are defined in the\n`config` dictionary. In this example, we initialize the `gsheet` plugin with the setting `method: oauth` and we\ninitialize the `sqlalchemy` plugin (aliased as \"sql\") with a `connection_url` that is set via an environment variable.\n\nPlease remember that using plugins may require you to add additional dependencies to the Python environment that your dbt-duckdb pipeline runs in:\n\n* `excel` depends on `pandas`, and `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter` to perform writes\n* `gsheet` depends on `gspread` and `pandas`\n*  `iceberg` depends on `pyiceberg` and Python >= 3.8\n* `sqlalchemy` depends on `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, and the driver(s) you need\n\n**Experimental:**\n\n* `delta` depends on `deltalake`, [an example project](https://github.com/milicevica23/dbt-duckdb-delta-plugin-demo)\n\n**Note:** Be aware that experimental features can change over time, and we would like your feedback on config and possible different use cases.\n\n#### Using Local Python Modules\n\nIn dbt-duckdb 1.6.0, we added a new profile setting named `module_paths` that allows users to specify a list\nof paths on the filesystem that contain additional Python modules that should be added to the Python processes'\n`sys.path` property. This allows users to include additional helper Python modules in their dbt projects that\ncan be accessed by the running dbt process and used to define custom dbt-duckdb Plugins or library code that is\nhelpful for creating dbt Python models.\n\n### Reading and Writing External Files\n\nOne of DuckDB's most powerful features is its ability to read and write CSV, JSON, and Parquet files directly, without needing to import/export\nthem from the database first.\n\n#### Reading from external files\n\nYou may reference external files in your dbt models either directly or as dbt `source`s by configuring the `external_location`\nin either the `meta` or the `config` option on the source definition. The difference is that settings under the `meta` option\nwill be propagated to the documentation for the source generated via `dbt docs generate`, but the settings under the `config`\noption will not be. Any source settings that should be excluded from the docs should be specified via `config`, while any\noptions that you would like to be included in the generated documentation should live under `meta`.\n\n```\nsources:\n  - name: external_source\n    meta:\n      external_location: \"s3://my-bucket/my-sources/{name}.parquet\"\n    tables:\n      - name: source1\n      - name: source2\n```\n\nHere, the `meta` options on `external_source` defines `external_location` as an [f-string](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/) that\nallows us to express a pattern that indicates the location of any of the tables defined for that source. So a dbt model like:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM {{ source('external_source', 'source1') }}\n```\n\nwill be compiled as:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM 's3://my-bucket/my-sources/source1.parquet'\n```\n\nIf one of the source tables deviates from the pattern or needs some other special handling, then the `external_location` can also be set on the `meta`\noptions for the table itself, for example:\n\n```\nsources:\n  - name: external_source\n    meta:\n      external_location: \"s3://my-bucket/my-sources/{name}.parquet\"\n    tables:\n      - name: source1\n      - name: source2\n        config:\n          external_location: \"read_parquet(['s3://my-bucket/my-sources/source2a.parquet', 's3://my-bucket/my-sources/source2b.parquet'])\"\n```\n\nIn this situation, the `external_location` setting on the `source2` table will take precedence, so a dbt model like:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM {{ source('external_source', 'source2') }}\n```\n\nwill be compiled to the SQL query:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM read_parquet(['s3://my-bucket/my-sources/source2a.parquet', 's3://my-bucket/my-sources/source2b.parquet'])\n```\n\nNote that the value of the `external_location` property does not need to be a path-like string; it can also be a function\ncall, which is helpful in the case that you have an external source that is a CSV file which requires special handling for DuckDB to load it correctly:\n\n```\nsources:\n  - name: flights_source\n    tables:\n      - name: flights\n        config:\n          external_location: \"read_csv('flights.csv', types={'FlightDate': 'DATE'}, names=['FlightDate', 'UniqueCarrier'])\"\n          formatter: oldstyle\n```\n\nNote that we need to override the default `str.format` string formatting strategy for this example\nbecause the `types={'FlightDate': 'DATE'}` argument to the `read_csv` function will be interpreted by\n`str.format` as a template to be matched on, which will cause a `KeyError: \"'FlightDate'\"` when we attempt\nto parse the source in a dbt model. The `formatter` configuration option for the source indicates whether\nwe should use `newstyle` string formatting (the default), `oldstyle` string formatting, or `template` string\nformatting. You can read up on the strategies the various string formatting techniques use at this\n[Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13451989/pythons-many-ways-of-string-formatting-are-the-older-ones-going-to-be-depre) and see examples of their use\nin this [dbt-duckdb integration test](https://github.com/jwills/dbt-duckdb/blob/master/tests/functional/adapter/test_sources.py).\n\n#### Writing to external files\n\nWe support creating dbt models that are backed by external files via the `external` materialization strategy:\n\n```\n{{ config(materialized='external', location='local/directory/file.parquet') }}\nSELECT m.*, s.id IS NOT NULL as has_source_id\nFROM {{ ref('upstream_model') }} m\nLEFT JOIN {{ source('upstream', 'source') }} s USING (id)\n```\n\n| Option | Default | Description\n| :---:    |  :---:    | ---\n| location | [external_location](dbt/include/duckdb/macros/utils/external_location.sql) macro | The path to write the external materialization to. See below for more details.\n| format | parquet | The format of the external file (parquet, csv, or json)\n| delimiter | ,    | For CSV files, the delimiter to use for fields.\n| options | None | Any other options to pass to DuckDB's `COPY` operation (e.g., `partition_by`, `codec`, etc.)\n| glue_register | false | If true, try to register the file created by this model with the AWS Glue Catalog.\n| glue_database | default | The name of the AWS Glue database to register the model with.\n\nIf the `location` argument is specified, it must be a filename (or S3 bucket/path), and dbt-duckdb will attempt to infer\nthe `format` argument from the file extension of the `location` if the `format` argument is unspecified (this functionality was\nadded in version 1.4.1.)\n\nIf the `location` argument is _not_ specified, then the external file will be named after the model.sql (or model.py) file that defined it\nwith an extension that matches the `format` argument (`parquet`, `csv`, or `json`). By default, the external files are created\nrelative to the current working directory, but you can change the default directory (or S3 bucket/prefix) by specifying the\n`external_root` setting in your DuckDB profile.\n\nUnfortunately incremental materialization strategies are not yet supported for `external` models.\n\n\n#### Incremental Strategy Configuration\n\ndbt-duckdb supports the `delete+insert`, `append`, and `merge` strategies for incremental `table` models. The `merge` strategy requires DuckDB >= 1.4.0 and provides access to DuckDB's native MERGE statement.\n\n**Append Strategy:**\n\n| Configuration | Type | Default | Description |\n|---------------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `incremental_predicates` | list | null | SQL conditions to filter which records get appended |\n\nExample:\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my_incremental_model\n    config:\n      materialized: incremental\n      incremental_strategy: append\n      incremental_predicates: [\"created_at > (select max(created_at) from {{ this }})\"]\n```\n\n**Delete+Insert Strategy:**\n\n| Configuration | Type | Default | Description |\n|---------------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `unique_key` | string/list | required | Column(s) used to identify records for deletion |\n| `incremental_predicates` | list | null | SQL conditions to filter the delete and insert operations |\n\nExample:\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my_incremental_model\n    config:\n      materialized: incremental\n      incremental_strategy: delete+insert\n      unique_key: id  # or ['id', 'date'] for composite keys\n      incremental_predicates: [\"updated_at >= '2023-01-01'\"]\n```\n\n**Merge Strategy (DuckDB >= 1.4.0):**\n\nThe merge strategy leverages DuckDB's native MERGE statement to efficiently synchronize data between your incremental model and the target table. This strategy offers three configuration approaches: basic configuration (using simple options), enhanced configuration with explicit column control, and fully custom merge clauses.\n\n**Basic Configuration (Default Behavior):**\n\nWhen you specify only `unique_key`, dbt-duckdb uses DuckDB's `UPDATE BY NAME` and `INSERT BY NAME` operations, which automatically match columns by name between source and target tables.\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my_incremental_model\n    config:\n      materialized: incremental\n      incremental_strategy: merge\n      unique_key: id  # or ['id', 'date'] for composite keys\n```\n\nThis generates SQL equivalent to:\n```sql\nMERGE INTO target AS DBT_INTERNAL_DEST\nUSING source AS DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE\nON (DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.id = DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.id)\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE BY NAME\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT BY NAME\n```\n\n**Enhanced Configuration:**\n\nThese options extend the basic merge behavior with additional control over which records get updated or inserted, which columns are affected, and how values are set.\n\n| Configuration | Type | Default | Description |\n|---------------|------|---------|-------------|\n| `unique_key` | string/list | required | Column(s) used for the MERGE join condition |\n| `incremental_predicates` | list | null | Additional SQL conditions to filter the MERGE operation |\n| `merge_on_using_columns` | list | null | Columns for USING clause syntax instead of ON for the join condition |\n| `merge_update_condition` | string | null | SQL condition to control when matched records are updated |\n| `merge_insert_condition` | string | null | SQL condition to control when unmatched records are inserted |\n| `merge_update_columns` | list | null | Specific columns to update |\n| `merge_exclude_columns` | list | null | Columns to exclude from updates |\n| `merge_update_set_expressions` | dict | null | Custom expressions for column updates |\n| `merge_returning_columns` | list | null | Columns to return from the MERGE operation |\n\n**Example with Enhanced Options:**\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my_incremental_model\n    config:\n      materialized: incremental\n      incremental_strategy: merge\n      unique_key: id\n      merge_update_condition: \"DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.age < DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.age\"\n      merge_insert_condition: \"DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.status != 'inactive'\"\n      merge_update_columns: ['name', 'age', 'status']\n      merge_exclude_columns: ['created_at']\n      merge_update_set_expressions:\n        updated_at: \"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\"\n        version: \"COALESCE(DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.version, 0) + 1\"\n```\n\n**Custom Merge Clauses:**\n\nFor maximum flexibility, use `merge_clauses` to define custom `when_matched` and `when_not_matched` behaviors.  This is especially helpful in more complex scenarios where you have more than one action, multiple conditions, or error handling within a `when_matched` or `when_not_matched` clause.\n\n*Supported When Matched Actions and Modes:*\n- `update`: Update the matched record\n  - `mode: by_name`: Use `UPDATE BY NAME` (default)\n  - `mode: by_position`: Use `UPDATE BY POSITION`\n  - `mode: star`: Use `UPDATE SET *`\n  - `mode: explicit`: Use explicit column list with custom expressions\n    - `update.include`: List of columns to include in the update\n    - `update.exclude`: List of columns to exclude from the update\n    - `update.set_expressions`: Dictionary of column-to-expression mappings for custom update values\n- `delete`: Delete the matched record\n- `do_nothing`: Skip the matched record\n- `error`: Raise an error for matched records\n  - `error_message`: Optional custom error message\n\n*Supported When Not Matched Actions and Modes:*\n- `insert`: Insert the unmatched record\n  - `mode: by_name`: Use `INSERT BY NAME` (default)\n  - `mode: by_position`: Use `INSERT BY POSITION`\n  - `mode: star`: Use `INSERT *`\n  - `mode: explicit`: Use explicit column and value lists\n    - `insert.columns`: List of column names for the INSERT statement\n    - `insert.values`: List of values/expressions corresponding to the columns\n- `update`: Update unmatched records (for WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE scenarios)\n  - `set_expressions`: Dictionary of column-to-expression mappings\n- `delete`: Delete unmatched records\n- `do_nothing`: Skip the unmatched record\n- `error`: Raise an error for unmatched records\n  - `error_message`: Optional custom error message\n\n**Example with Custom Merge Clauses:**\n\n```yaml\nmodels:\n  - name: my_incremental_model\n    config:\n      materialized: incremental\n      incremental_strategy: merge\n      unique_key: id\n      merge_clauses:\n        when_matched:\n          - action: update\n            mode: explicit\n            condition: \"DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.status = 'active'\"\n            update:\n              include: ['name', 'email', 'status']\n              exclude: ['created_at']\n              set_expressions:\n                updated_at: \"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\"\n                version: \"COALESCE(DBT_INTERNAL_DEST.version, 0) + 1\"\n          - action: delete\n            condition: \"DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.status = 'deleted'\"\n        when_not_matched:\n          - action: insert\n            mode: explicit\n            insert:\n              columns: ['id', 'name', 'email', 'created_at']\n              values: ['DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.id', 'DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.name', 'DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE.email', 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP']\n```\n\n**DuckLake Restrictions:**\n\nWhen using DuckLake (attached DuckLake databases), MERGE statements are limited to a single UPDATE or DELETE action in `when_matched` clauses due to DuckLake's current MERGE implementation constraints.\n\n**Table Aliases:**\n\nIn conditions and expressions, use these table aliases:\n- `DBT_INTERNAL_SOURCE`: References the incoming data (your model's SELECT)\n- `DBT_INTERNAL_DEST`: References the existing target table\n\n#### Re-running external models with an in-memory version of dbt-duckdb\nWhen using `:memory:` as the DuckDB database, subsequent dbt runs can fail when selecting a subset of models that depend on external tables. This is because external files are only registered as  DuckDB views when they are created, not when they are referenced. To overcome this issue we have provided the `register_upstream_external_models` macro that can be triggered at the beginning of a run. To enable this automatic registration, place the following in your `dbt_project.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\non-run-start:\n  - \"{{ register_upstream_external_models() }}\"\n```\n\n### `table_function` Materialization\n\ndbt-duckdb also provides a custom table_function materialization to use DuckDB's Table Function / Table Macro feature to provide parameterized views.\n\nWhy use this materialization?\n* Late binding of functions means that the underlying table can change (have new columns added) and the function does not need to be recreated.\n  * (With a view, the create view statement would need to be re-run).\n  * This allows for skipping parts of the dbt DAG, even if the underlying table changed.\n* Parameters can force filter pushdown\n* Functions can provide advanced features like dynamic SQL (the query and query_table functions)\n\n\nExample table_function creation with 0 parameters:\n```sql\n{{\n    config(\n        materialized='table_function'\n    )\n}}\nselect * from {{ ref(\"example_table\") }}\n```\n\nExample table_function invocation (note the parentheses are needed even with 0 parameters!):\n```sql\nselect * from {{ ref(\"my_table_function\") }}()\n```\n\nExample table_function creation with 2 parameters:\n```sql\n{{\n    config(\n        materialized='table_function',\n        parameters=['where_a', 'where_b']\n    )\n}}\nselect *\nfrom {{ ref(\"example_table\") }}\nwhere 1=1\n    and a = where_a\n    and b = where_b\n```\n\nExample table_function with 2 parameters invocation:\n```sql\nselect * from {{ ref(\"my_table_function_with_parameters\") }}(1, 2)\n```\n\n### Python Support\n\ndbt added support for [Python models in version 1.3.0](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/python-models). For most data platforms,\ndbt will package up the Python code defined in a `.py` file and ship it off to be executed in whatever Python environment that\ndata platform supports (e.g., Snowpark for Snowflake or Dataproc for BigQuery.) In dbt-duckdb, we execute Python models in the same\nprocess that owns the connection to the DuckDB database, which by default, is the Python process that is created when you run dbt.\nTo execute the Python model, we treat the `.py` file that your model is defined in as a Python module and load it into the\nrunning process using [importlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html). We then construct the arguments to the `model`\nfunction that you defined (a `dbt` object that contains the names of any `ref` and `source` information your model needs and a\n`DuckDBPyConnection` object for you to interact with the underlying DuckDB database), call the `model` function, and then materialize\nthe returned object as a table in DuckDB.\n\nThe value of the `dbt.ref` and `dbt.source` functions inside of a Python model will be a [DuckDB Relation](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/python/reference/)\nobject that can be easily converted into a Pandas/Polars DataFrame or an Arrow table. The return value of the `model` function can be\nany Python object that DuckDB knows how to turn into a table, including a Pandas/Polars `DataFrame`, a DuckDB `Relation`, or an Arrow `Table`,\n`Dataset`, `RecordBatchReader`, or `Scanner`.\n\n#### Batch processing with Python models\n\nAs of version 1.6.1, it is possible to both read and write data in chunks, which allows for larger-than-memory\ndatasets to be manipulated in Python models. Here is a basic example:\n```\nimport pyarrow as pa\n\ndef batcher(batch_reader: pa.RecordBatchReader):\n    for batch in batch_reader:\n        df = batch.to_pandas()\n        # Do some operations on the DF...\n        # ...then yield back a new batch\n        yield pa.RecordBatch.from_pandas(df)\n\ndef model(dbt, session):\n    big_model = dbt.ref(\"big_model\")\n    batch_reader = big_model.record_batch(100_000)\n    batch_iter = batcher(batch_reader)\n    return pa.RecordBatchReader.from_batches(batch_reader.schema, batch_iter)\n```\n\n### Writing Your Own Plugins\n\nDefining your own dbt-duckdb plugin is as simple as creating a python module that defines a class named `Plugin` that\ninherits from [dbt.adapters.duckdb.plugins.BasePlugin](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/__init__.py). There are currently\nfour methods that may be implemented in your Plugin class:\n\n1. `initialize`: Takes in the `config` dictionary for the plugin that is defined in the profile to enable any\nadditional configuration for the module based on the project; this method is called once when an instance of the\n`Plugin` class is created.\n1. `configure_connection`: Takes an instance of the `DuckDBPyConnection` object used to connect to the DuckDB\ndatabase and may perform any additional configuration of that object that is needed by the plugin, like defining\ncustom user-defined functions.\n1. `load`: Takes a [SourceConfig](dbt/adapters/duckdb/utils.py) instance, which encapsulates the configuration for a\na dbt source and can optionally return a DataFrame-like object that DuckDB knows how to turn into a table (this is\nsimilar to a dbt-duckdb Python model, but without the ability to `ref` any models or access any information beyond\nthe source config.)\n1. `store`: Takes a [TargetConfig](dbt/adapters/duckdb/utils.py) instance, which encapsulates the configuration for\nan `external` materialization and can perform additional operations once the CSV/Parquet/JSON file is written. The\n[glue](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/glue.py) and [sqlalchemy](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/sqlalchemy.py) are examples\nthat demonstrate how to use the `store` operation to register an AWS Glue database table or upload a DataFrame to\nan external database, respectively.\n\ndbt-duckdb ships with a number of [built-in plugins](dbt/adapters/duckdb/plugins/) that can be used as examples\nfor implementing your own.\n\n### Interactive Shell\n\nAs of version 1.9.3, dbt-duckdb includes an interactive shell that allows you to run dbt commands and query the DuckDB database in an integrated CLI environment. The shell automatically launches the [DuckDB UI](https://duckdb.org/2025/03/12/duckdb-ui.html), providing a visual interface to explore your data while working with your dbt models.\n\nTo start the interactive shell, use:\n\n```\npython -m dbt.adapters.duckdb.cli\n```\n\nYou can specify a profile to use with the `--profile` flag:\n\n```\npython -m dbt.adapters.duckdb.cli --profile my_profile\n```\n\nThe shell provides access to all standard dbt commands:\n- `run` - Run dbt models\n- `test` - Run tests on dbt models\n- `build` - Build and test dbt models\n- `seed` - Load seed files\n- `snapshot` - Run snapshots\n- `compile` - Compile models without running them\n- `parse` - Parse the project\n- `debug` - Debug connection\n- `deps` - Install dependencies\n- `list` - List resources\n\nWhen you launch the shell, it automatically:\n1. Runs `dbt debug` to test your connection\n2. Parses your dbt project\n3. Launches the DuckDB UI for visual data exploration\n\nThe shell supports model name autocompletion if you install the optional `iterfzf` package:\n\n```\npip install iterfzf\n```\n\nExample workflow:\n1. Start the interactive shell\n2. View your project's models in the launched DuckDB UI\n3. Run `build` to build your models\n4. Immediately see the results in the UI and continue iterating\n\nThis interactive environment makes it easier to develop and test dbt models while simultaneously exploring the data in a visual interface.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nThings that we would like to add in the near future:\n\n* Support for Delta and Iceberg external table formats (both as sources and destinations)\n* Make dbt's incremental models and snapshots work with external materializations\n\n",

Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.\n\n## dbt-postgres\n\n`dbt-postgres` enables dbt to work with Postgres.\nFor more information on using dbt with Postgres, consult [the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/profile-postgres).\n\n# Getting started\n\nReview the repository [README.md](../README.md) as most of that information pertains to `dbt-postgres`.\n\n### psycopg2-binary vs. psycopg2\n\nBy default, `dbt-postgres` installs `psycopg2-binary`.\nThis is great for development, and even testing, as it does not require any OS dependencies; it's a pre-built wheel.\nHowever, building `psycopg2` from source will grant performance improvements that are desired in a production environment.\nIn order to install `psycopg2`, use the following steps:\n\n```bash\nif [[ $(pip show psycopg2-binary) ]]; then\n    PSYCOPG2_VERSION=$(pip show psycopg2-binary | grep Version | cut -d \" \" -f 2)\n    pip uninstall -y psycopg2-binary\n    pip install psycopg2==$PSYCOPG2_VERSION\nfi\n```\n\nThis ensures the version of `psycopg2` will match that of `psycopg2-binary`.\n\n## Contribute\n\n- Want to help us build `dbt-postgres`?

The next patch release\nwill try to address the remaining issues with *serialize as any* behavior by introducing a new *polymorphic serialization* feature, that\nshould be used in most cases in place of *serialize as any*.\n\n* Fix issue with forward references in parent `TypedDict` classes by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12427](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12427).\n\n    This issue is only relevant on Python 3.14 and greater.\n* Exclude fields with `exclude_if` from JSON Schema required fields by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12430](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12430)\n* Revert URL percent-encoding of credentials in the `build()` method\n  of the [`AnyUrl` and Dsn types](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/networks/) by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in\n  [pydantic-core#1833](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1833).\n\n    This was initially considered as a bugfix, but caused regressions and as such was fully reverted. The next release will include\n    an opt-in option to percent-encode components of the URL.\n* Add type inference for IP address types by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1868](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1868).\n\n    The 2.12 changes to the `serialize_as_any` behavior made it so that IP address types could not properly serialize to JSON.\n* Avoid getting default values from defaultdict by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1853](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1853).\n\n    This fixes a subtle regression in the validation behavior of the [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict)\n    type.\n* Fix issue with field serializers on nested typed dictionaries by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1879](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1879).\n* Add more `pydantic-core` builds for the three-threaded version of Python 3.14 by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1864](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1864).\n\n## v2.12.3 (2025-10-17)\n\n[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.3)\n\n### What's Changed\n\nThis is the third 2.12 patch release, fixing issues related to the `FieldInfo` class, and reverting a change to the supported\n[*after* model validator](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#model-validators) function signatures.\n\n* Raise a warning when an invalid after model validator function signature is raised by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12414](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12414).\n  Starting in 2.12.0, using class methods for *after* model validators raised an error, but the error wasn't raised concistently. We decided\n  to emit a deprecation warning instead.\n* Add [`FieldInfo.asdict()`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/fields/#pydantic.fields.FieldInfo.asdict) method, improve documentation around `FieldInfo` by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12411](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12411).\n  This also add back support for mutations on `FieldInfo` classes, that are reused as `Annotated` metadata. **However**, note that this is still\n  *not* a supported pattern. Instead, please refer to the [added example](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/examples/dynamic_models/) in the documentation.\n\nThe [blog post](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-v2-12-release#changes) section on changes was also updated to document the changes related to `serialize_as_any`.\n\n## v2.12.2 (2025-10-14)\n\n[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.2)\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Fixes\n\n* Release a new `pydantic-core` version, as a corrupted CPython 3.10 `manylinux2014_aarch64` wheel got uploaded ([pydantic-core#1843](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1843)).\n* Fix issue with recursive generic models with a parent model class by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12398](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12398)\n\n## v2.12.1 (2025-10-13)\n\n[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.1)\n\n### What's Changed\n\nThis is the first 2.12 patch release, addressing most (but not all yet) regressions from the initial 2.12.0 release.\n\n#### Fixes\n\n* Do not evaluate annotations when inspecting validators and serializers by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12355](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12355)\n* Make sure `None` is converted as `NoneType` in Python 3.14 by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12370](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12370)\n* Backport V1 runtime warning when using Python 3.14 by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12367](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12367)\n* Fix error message for invalid validator signatures by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [#12366](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/12366)\n* Populate field name in `ValidationInfo` for validation of default value by [@Viicos](https://github.com/Viicos) in [pydantic-core#1826](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1826)\n* Encode credentials in `MultiHostUrl` builder by [@willswire](https://github.com/willswire) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)\n* Respect field serializers when using `serialize_as_any` serialization flag by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)\n* Fix various `RootModel` serialization issues by [@davidhewitt](https://github.com/davidhewitt) in [pydantic-core#1836](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1836)\n\n### New Contributors\n\n* [@willswire](https://github.com/willswire) made their first contribution in [pydantic-core#1829](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/pull/1829)\n\n## v2.12.0 (2025-10-07)\n\n[GitHub release](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/releases/tag/v2.12.0)\n\n### What's Changed\n\nThis is the final 2.12 release.

Models frequently build on top of one another – dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).\n\n![dbt dag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/6c6649f9129d5d108aa3b0526f634cd8f3a9d1ed/etc/dbt-dag.png)\n\n## Getting started\n\n- [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)\n- Read the [introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction/) and [viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint/)\n\n## Join the dbt Community\n\n- Be part of the conversation in the [dbt Community Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/)\n- Read more on the [dbt Community Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com)\n\n## Reporting bugs and contributing code\n\n- Want to report a bug or request a feature? Let us know on [Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/), or open [an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/new)\n- Want to help us build dbt? Check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone interacting in the dbt project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [dbt Code of Conduct](https://community.getdbt.com/code-of-conduct).\n",

Expect huge difference on large payload.\n\n> Stats are generated using 400+ files using default parameters. More details on used files, see GHA workflows.\n> And yes, these results might change at any time. The dataset can be updated to include more files.\n> The actual delays heavily depends on your CPU capabilities. The factors should remain the same.\n> Keep in mind that the stats are generous and that Chardet accuracy vs our is measured using Chardet initial capability\n> (e.g. Supported Encoding) Challenge-them if you want.\n\n## ✨ Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```sh\npip install charset-normalizer -U\n```\n\n## 🚀 Basic Usage\n\n### CLI\nThis package comes with a CLI.\n\n```\nusage: normalizer [-h] [-v] [-a] [-n] [-m] [-r] [-f] [-t THRESHOLD]\n                  file [file ...]\n\nThe Real First Universal Charset Detector.

We ensure that we offer the best (reasonable) BC result possible.\n\nSee the docs for advanced usage : [readthedocs.io](https://charset-normalizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n## 😇 Why\n\nWhen I started using Chardet, I noticed that it was not suited to my expectations, and I wanted to propose a\nreliable alternative using a completely different method. Also! I never back down on a good challenge!\n\nI **don't care** about the **originating charset** encoding, because **two different tables** can\nproduce **two identical rendered string.**\nWhat I want is to get readable text, the best I can.\n\nIn a way, **I'm brute forcing text decoding.** How cool is that ? 😎\n\nDon't confuse package **ftfy** with charset-normalizer or chardet. ftfy goal is to repair Unicode string whereas charset-normalizer to convert raw file in unknown encoding to unicode.\n\n## 🍰 How\n\n  - Discard all charset encoding table that could not fit the binary content.\n  - Measure noise, or the mess once opened (by chunks) with a corresponding charset encoding.\n  - Extract matches with the lowest mess detected.\n  - Additionally, we measure coherence / probe for a language.\n\n**Wait a minute**, what is noise/mess and coherence according to **YOU ?**\n\n*Noise :* I opened hundred of text files, **written by humans**, with the wrong encoding table. **I observed**, then\n**I established** some ground rules about **what is obvious** when **it seems like** a mess (aka. defining noise in rendered text).\n I know that my interpretation of what is noise is probably incomplete, feel free to contribute in order to\n improve or rewrite it.\n\n*Coherence :* For each language there is on earth, we have computed ranked letter appearance occurrences (the best we can). So I thought\nthat intel is worth something here. So I use those records against decoded text to check if I can detect intelligent design.\n\n## ⚡ Known limitations\n\n  - Language detection is unreliable when text contains two or more languages sharing identical letters. (eg. HTML (english tags) + Turkish content (Sharing Latin characters))\n  - Every charset detector heavily depends on sufficient content. In common cases, do not bother run detection on very tiny content.\n\n## ⚠️ About Python EOLs\n\n**If you are running:**\n\n- Python >=2.7,<3.5: Unsupported\n- Python 3.5: charset-normalizer < 2.1\n- Python 3.6: charset-normalizer < 3.1\n- Python 3.7: charset-normalizer < 4.0\n\nUpgrade your Python interpreter as soon as possible.\n\n## 👤 Contributing\n\nContributions, issues and feature requests are very much welcome.<br />\nFeel free to check [issues page](https://github.com/ousret/charset_normalizer/issues) if you want to contribute.\n\n## 📝 License\n\nCopyright © [Ahmed TAHRI @Ousret](https://github.com/Ousret).<br />\nThis project is [MIT](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/blob/master/LICENSE) licensed.\n\nCharacters frequencies used in this project © 2012 [Denny Vrandečić](http://simia.net/letters/)\n\n## 💼 For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for charset-normalizer is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].

(+Using static typing)+\n- utf_7 detection has been reinstated.\n\n### Removed\n- This package no longer require anything when used with Python 3.5 (Dropped cached_property)\n- Removed support for these languages: Catalan, Esperanto, Kazakh, Baque, Volapük, Azeri, Galician, Nynorsk, Macedonian, and Serbocroatian.\n- The exception hook on UnicodeDecodeError has been removed.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Methods coherence_non_latin, w_counter, chaos_secondary_pass of the class CharsetMatch are now deprecated and scheduled for removal in v3.0\n\n### Fixed\n- The CLI output used the relative path of the file(s). Should be absolute.\n\n## [1.4.1](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.4.0...1.4.1) (2021-05-28)\n### Fixed\n- Logger configuration/usage no longer conflict with others (PR #44)\n\n## [1.4.0](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.9...1.4.0) (2021-05-21)\n### Removed\n- Using standard logging instead of using the package loguru.\n- Dropping nose test framework in favor of the maintained pytest.\n- Choose to not use dragonmapper package to help with gibberish Chinese/CJK text.\n- Require cached_property only for Python 3.5 due to constraint. Dropping for every other interpreter version.\n- Stop support for UTF-7 that does not contain a SIG.\n- Dropping PrettyTable, replaced with pure JSON output in CLI.\n\n### Fixed\n- BOM marker in a CharsetNormalizerMatch instance could be False in rare cases even if obviously present. Due to the sub-match factoring process.\n- Not searching properly for the BOM when trying utf32/16 parent codec.\n\n### Changed\n- Improving the package final size by compressing frequencies.json.\n- Huge improvement over the larges payload.\n\n### Added\n- CLI now produces JSON consumable output.\n- Return ASCII if given sequences fit. Given reasonable confidence.\n\n## [1.3.9](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.8...1.3.9) (2021-05-13)\n\n### Fixed\n- In some very rare cases, you may end up getting encode/decode errors due to a bad bytes payload (PR #40)\n\n## [1.3.8](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.7...1.3.8) (2021-05-12)\n\n### Fixed\n- Empty given payload for detection may cause an exception if trying to access the `alphabets` property. (PR #39)\n\n## [1.3.7](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.6...1.3.7) (2021-05-12)\n\n### Fixed\n- The legacy detect function should return UTF-8-SIG if sig is present in the payload. (PR #38)\n\n## [1.3.6](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.5...1.3.6) (2021-02-09)\n\n### Changed\n- Amend the previous release to allow prettytable 2.0 (PR #35)\n\n## [1.3.5](https://github.com/Ousret/charset_normalizer/compare/1.3.4...1.3.5) (2021-02-08)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix error while using the package with a python pre-release interpreter (PR #33)\n\n### Changed\n- Dependencies refactoring, constraints revised.\n\n### Added\n- Add python 3.9 and 3.10 to the supported interpreters\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 TAHRI Ahmed R.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n  Olson's database.\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n* A comprehensive test suite.\n\nQuick example\n=============\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\ndate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).

href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hynek\">joining them</a> to help make <em>attrs</em>’s maintenance more sustainable!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<!-- teaser-end -->\n\n## Example\n\n*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:\n\n<!-- code-begin -->\n\n```pycon\n>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory\n\n>>> @define\n... class SomeClass:\n...     a_number: int = 42\n...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)\n...\n...     def hard_math(self, another_number):\n...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number\n\n\n>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\n>>> sc\nSomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])\n\n>>> sc.hard_math(3)\n19\n>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\nTrue\n>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])\nTrue\n\n>>> asdict(sc)\n{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}\n\n>>> SomeClass()\nSomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])\n\n>>> C = make_class(\"C\", [\"a\", \"b\"])\n>>> C(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nC(a='foo', b='bar')\n```\n\nAfter *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:\n\n- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,\n- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,\n- equality-checking methods,\n- an initializer,\n- and much more,\n\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.\n\n---\n\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\n\nCheck out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for an in-depth explanation!\n\n\n### Hate Type Annotations!?\n\nNo problem!\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types:\n\n```python\nfrom attrs import define, field\n\n@define\nclass SomeClass:\n    a_number = field(default=42)\n    list_of_numbers = field(factory=list)\n```\n\n\n## Data Classes\n\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\nFor instance, it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), has a replacement for `__init_subclass__`, and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes), but generally speaking, we are more likely to commit crimes against nature to make things work that one would expect to work, but that are quite complicated in practice.\n\n\n## Project Information\n\n- [**Changelog**](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n-

Subscription](https://tidelift.com/?utm_source=lifter&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=hynek).\n\nThe maintainers of *attrs* and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source packages you use to build your applications.\nSave time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact packages you use.\n\n## Release Information\n\n### Backwards-incompatible Changes\n\n- Class-level `kw_only=True` behavior is now consistent with `dataclasses`.\n\n  Previously, a class that sets `kw_only=True` makes all attributes keyword-only, including those from base classes.\n  If an attribute sets `kw_only=False`, that setting is ignored, and it is still made keyword-only.\n\n  Now, only the attributes defined in that class that doesn't explicitly set `kw_only=False` are made keyword-only.\n\n  This shouldn't be a problem for most users, unless you have a pattern like this:\n\n  ```python\n  @attrs.define(kw_only=True)\n  class Base:\n      a: int\n      b: int = attrs.field(default=1, kw_only=False)\n\n  @attrs.define\n  class Subclass(Base):\n      c: int\n  ```\n\n  Here, we have a `kw_only=True` *attrs* class (`Base`) with an attribute that sets `kw_only=False` and has a default (`Base.b`), and then create a subclass (`Subclass`) with required arguments (`Subclass.c`).\n  Previously this would work, since it would make `Base.b` keyword-only, but now this fails since `Base.b` is positional, and we have a required positional argument (`Subclass.c`) following another argument with defaults.\n  [#1457](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1457)\n\n\n### Changes\n\n- Values passed to the `__init__()` method of `attrs` classes are now correctly passed to `__attrs_pre_init__()` instead of their default values (in cases where *kw_only* was not specified).\n  [#1427](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1427)\n- Added support for Python 3.14 and [PEP 749](https://peps.python.org/pep-0749/).\n  [#1446](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1446),\n  [#1451](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1451)\n- `attrs.validators.deep_mapping()` now allows to leave out either *key_validator* xor *value_validator*.\n  [#1448](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1448)\n- `attrs.validators.deep_iterator()` and `attrs.validators.deep_mapping()` now accept lists and tuples for all validators and wrap them into a `attrs.validators.and_()`.\n  [#1449](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1449)\n- Added a new **experimental** way to inspect classes:\n\n  `attrs.inspect(cls)` returns the _effective_ class-wide parameters that were used by *attrs* to construct the class.\n\n  The returned class is the same data structure that *attrs* uses internally to decide how to construct the final class.\n  [#1454](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1454)\n- Fixed annotations for `attrs.field(converter=...)`.\n  Previously, a `tuple` of converters was only accepted if it had exactly one element.\n  [#1461](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1461)\n- The performance of `attrs.asdict()` has been improved by 45–260%.\n  [#1463](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1463)\n- The performance of `attrs.astuple()` has been improved by 49–270%.\n  [#1469](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1469)\n- The type annotation for `attrs.validators.or_()` now allows for different types of validators.\n\n  This was only an issue on Pyright.\n  [#1474](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1474)\n\n\n\n---\n\n[Full changelog →](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n",

different approaches to converting\nyour data to and from various formats. Each of them is useful in different\nsituations:\n\n* Codecs\n* Mixins\n\nCodecs are represented by a set of decoder / encoder classes and\ndecode / encode functions for each supported format. You can use them\nto convert data of any python built-in and third-party type to JSON, YAML,\nTOML, MessagePack or a basic form accepted by other serialization formats.\nFor example, you can convert a list of datetime objects to JSON array\ncontaining string-represented datetimes and vice versa.\n\nMixins are primarily for dataclass models. They are represented by mixin\nclasses that add methods for converting to and from JSON, YAML, TOML,\nMessagePack or a basic form accepted by other serialization formats.\nIf you have a root dataclass model, then it will be the easiest way to make it\nserializable. All you have to do is inherit a particular mixin class.\n\nIn addition to serialization functionality, this library also provides JSON\nSchema builder that can be used in places where interoperability matters.\n\nInstallation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse pip to install:\n```shell\n$ pip install mashumaro\n```\n\nThe current version of `mashumaro` supports Python versions 3.8 — 3.13.\n\n\nIt's not recommended to use any version of Python that has reached its\n[end of life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) and is no longer receiving\nsecurity updates or bug fixes from the Python development team.\nFor convenience, there is a table below that outlines the\nlast version of `mashumaro` that can be installed on unmaintained versions\nof Python.\n\n| Python Version | Last Version of mashumaro                                          | Python EOL

example\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSuppose we're developing a financial application and we operate with currencies\nand stocks:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Currency(Enum):\n    USD = \"USD\"\n    EUR = \"EUR\"\n\n@dataclass\nclass CurrencyPosition:\n    currency: Currency\n    balance: float\n\n@dataclass\nclass StockPosition:\n    ticker: str\n    name: str\n    balance: int\n```\n\nNow we want a dataclass for portfolio that will be serialized to and from JSON.\nWe inherit `DataClassJSONMixin` that adds this functionality:\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.json import DataClassJSONMixin\n\n...\n\n@dataclass\nclass Portfolio(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    currencies: list[CurrencyPosition]\n    stocks: list[StockPosition]\n```\n\nLet's create a portfolio instance and check methods `from_json` and `to_json`:\n\n```python\nportfolio = Portfolio(\n    currencies=[\n        CurrencyPosition(Currency.USD, 238.67),\n        CurrencyPosition(Currency.EUR, 361.84),\n    ],\n    stocks=[\n        StockPosition(\"AAPL\", \"Apple\", 10),\n        StockPosition(\"AMZN\", \"Amazon\", 10),\n    ]\n)\n\nportfolio_json = portfolio.to_json()\nassert Portfolio.from_json(portfolio_json) == portfolio\n```\n\nIf we need to serialize something different from a root dataclass,\nwe can use codecs. In the following example we create a JSON decoder and encoder\nfor a list of currencies:\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.json import JSONDecoder, JSONEncoder\n\n...\n\ndecoder = JSONDecoder(list[CurrencyPosition])\nencoder = JSONEncoder(list[CurrencyPosition])\n\ncurrencies = [\n    CurrencyPosition(Currency.USD, 238.67),\n    CurrencyPosition(Currency.EUR, 361.84),\n]\ncurrencies_json = encoder.encode(currencies)\nassert decoder.decode(currencies_json) == currencies\n\n```\n\nHow does it work?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis library works by taking the schema of the data and generating a\nspecific decoder and encoder for exactly that schema, taking into account the\nspecifics of serialization format. This is much faster than inspection of\ndata types on every call of decoding or encoding at runtime.\n\nThese specific decoders and encoders are generated by\n[codecs and mixins](#supported-serialization-formats):\n* When using codecs, these methods are compiled during the creation of the\n  decoder or encoder.\n* When using serialization\nmixins, these methods are compiled during import time (or at runtime in some\ncases) and are set as attributes to your dataclasses. To minimize the import\ntime, you can explicitly enable\n[lazy compilation](#lazy_compilation-config-option).\n\nBenchmark\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* macOS 14.0 Sonoma\n* Apple M1\n* 16GB RAM\n* Python 3.12.0\n\nBenchmark using [pyperf](https://github.com/psf/pyperf) with GitHub Issue model.

These types are:\n[`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str),\n[`int`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int),\n[`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float),\n[`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-boolean-values),\n[`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list),\n[`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict).\n\nThis is also a starting point you can play with for a comprehensive\ntransformation of your data.\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs import BasicDecoder, BasicEncoder\n# or from mashumaro.codecs.basic import BasicDecoder, BasicEncoder\n\ndecoder = BasicDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = BasicEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.basic as basic_codec\n\nbasic_codec.decode(..., <shape_type>)\nbasic_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n# or from mashumaro.mixins.dict import DataClassDictMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassDictMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_dict(...)\nMyModel(...).to_dict()\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> You don't need to inherit `DataClassDictMixin` along with other serialization\n> mixins because it's a base class for them.\n\n### JSON\n\n[JSON](https://www.json.org) is a lightweight data-interchange format. You can\nchoose between standard library\n[json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) for compatibility and\nthird-party dependency [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) for better\nperformance.\n\n#### json library\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.json import JSONDecoder, JSONEncoder\n\ndecoder = JSONDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = JSONEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.json import json_decode, json_encode\n\njson_decode(..., <shape_type>)\njson_encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nConvenient function aliases are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.json as json_codec\n\njson_codec.decode(...<shape_type>)\njson_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.json import DataClassJSONMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_json(...)\nMyModel(...).to_json()\n```\n\n#### orjson library\n\nIn order to use [`orjson`](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) library, it must\nbe installed manually or using an extra option for `mashumaro`:\n\n```shell\npip install mashumaro[orjson]\n```\n\nThe following data types will be handled by\n[`orjson`](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) library by default:\n* [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)\n* [`date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date)\n* [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time)\n* [`uuid.UUID`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#uuid.UUID)\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.orjson import ORJSONDecoder, ORJSONEncoder\n\ndecoder = ORJSONDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = ORJSONEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.orjson import json_decode, json_encode\n\njson_decode(..., <shape_type>)\njson_encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nConvenient function aliases are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.orjson as json_codec\n\njson_codec.decode(...<shape_type>)\njson_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.orjson import DataClassORJSONMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassORJSONMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_json(...)\nMyModel(...).to_json()\nMyModel(...).to_jsonb()\n```\n\n### YAML\n\n[YAML](https://yaml.org) is a human-friendly data serialization language for\nall programming languages. In order to use this format, the\n[`pyyaml`](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) package must be installed.\nYou can install it manually or using an extra option for `mashumaro`:\n\n```shell\npip install mashumaro[yaml]\n```\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.yaml import YAMLDecoder, YAMLEncoder\n\ndecoder = YAMLDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = YAMLEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.yaml import yaml_decode, yaml_encode\n\nyaml_decode(..., <shape_type>)\nyaml_encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nConvenient function aliases are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.yaml as yaml_codec\n\nyaml_codec.decode(...<shape_type>)\nyaml_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.yaml import DataClassYAMLMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassYAMLMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_yaml(...)\nMyModel(...).to_yaml()\n```\n\n### TOML\n\n[TOML](https://toml.io) is config file format for humans.\nIn order to use this format, the [`tomli`](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/) and\n[`tomli-w`](https://pypi.org/project/tomli-w/) packages must be installed.\nIn Python 3.11+, `tomli` is included as\n[`tomlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) standard library\nmodule and is used for this format. You can install the missing packages\nmanually or using an extra option\nfor `mashumaro`:\n\n```shell\npip install mashumaro[toml]\n```\n\nThe following data types will be handled by\n[`tomli`](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/)/\n[`tomli-w`](https://pypi.org/project/tomli-w/) library by default:\n* [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime)\n* [`date`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date)\n* [`time`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.time)\n\nFields with value `None` will be omitted on serialization because TOML\ndoesn't support null values.\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.toml import TOMLDecoder, TOMLEncoder\n\ndecoder = TOMLDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = TOMLEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.toml import toml_decode, toml_encode\n\ntoml_decode(..., <shape_type>)\ntoml_encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nConvenient function aliases are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.toml as toml_codec\n\ntoml_codec.decode(...<shape_type>)\ntoml_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.toml import DataClassTOMLMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassTOMLMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_toml(...)\nMyModel(...).to_toml()\n```\n\n### MessagePack\n\n[MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) is an efficient binary serialization format.\nIn order to use this mixin, the [`msgpack`](https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/)\npackage must be installed. You can install it manually or using an extra\noption for `mashumaro`:\n\n```shell\npip install mashumaro[msgpack]\n```\n\nThe following data types will be handled by\n[`msgpack`](https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/) library by default:\n* [`bytes`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes)\n* [`bytearray`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray)\n\nEfficient decoder and encoder can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.msgpack import MessagePackDecoder, MessagePackEncoder\n\ndecoder = MessagePackDecoder(<shape_type>, ...)\ndecoder.decode(...)\n\nencoder = MessagePackEncoder(<shape_type>, ...)\nencoder.encode(...)\n```\n\nConvenient functions can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs.msgpack import msgpack_decode, msgpack_encode\n\nmsgpack_decode(..., <shape_type>)\nmsgpack_encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nConvenient function aliases are recommended to be used as follows:\n```python\nimport mashumaro.codecs.msgpack as msgpack_codec\n\nmsgpack_codec.decode(...<shape_type>)\nmsgpack_codec.encode(..., <shape_type>)\n```\n\nMixin can be used as follows:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.msgpack import DataClassMessagePackMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyModel(DataClassMessagePackMixin):\n    ...\n\nMyModel.from_msgpack(...)\nMyModel(...).to_msgpack()\n```\n\nCustomization\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomization options of `mashumaro` are extensive and will most likely cover your needs.\nWhen it comes to non-standard data types and non-standard serialization support, you can do the following:\n* Turn an existing regular or generic class into a serializable one\nby inheriting the [`SerializableType`](#serializabletype-interface) class\n* Write different serialization strategies for an existing regular or generic type that is not under your control\nusing [`SerializationStrategy`](#serializationstrategy) class\n* Define serialization / deserialization methods:\n  * for a specific dataclass field by using [field options](#field-options)\n  * for a specific data type used in the dataclass by using [`Config`](#config-options) class\n* Alter input and output data with serialization / deserialization [hooks](#serialization-hooks)\n* Separate serialization scheme from a dataclass in a reusable manner using [dialects](#dialects)\n* Choose from predefined serialization engines for the specific data types, e.g. `datetime` and `NamedTuple`\n\n### SerializableType interface\n\nIf you have a custom class or hierarchy of classes whose instances you want\nto serialize with `mashumaro`, the first option is to implement\n`SerializableType` interface.\n\n#### User-defined types\n\nLet's look at this not very practicable example:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializableType\n\nclass Airport(SerializableType):\n    def __init__(self, code, city):\n        self.code, self.city = code, city\n\n    def _serialize(self):\n        return [self.code, self.city]\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _deserialize(cls, value):\n        return cls(*value)\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.code, self.city == other.code, other.city\n\n@dataclass\nclass Flight(DataClassDictMixin):\n    origin: Airport\n    destination: Airport\n\nJFK = Airport(\"JFK\", \"New York City\")\nLAX = Airport(\"LAX\", \"Los Angeles\")\n\ninput_data = {\n    \"origin\": [\"JFK\", \"New York City\"],\n    \"destination\": [\"LAX\", \"Los Angeles\"]\n}\nmy_flight = Flight.from_dict(input_data)\nassert my_flight == Flight(JFK, LAX)\nassert my_flight.to_dict() == input_data\n```\n\nYou can see how `Airport` instances are seamlessly created from lists of two\nstrings and serialized into them.\n\nBy default `_deserialize` method will get raw input data without any\ntransformations before. This should be enough in many cases, especially when\nyou need to perform non-standard transformations yourself, but let's extend\nour example:\n\n```python\nclass Itinerary(SerializableType):\n    def __init__(self, flights):\n        self.flights = flights\n\n    def _serialize(self):\n        return self.flights\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _deserialize(cls, flights):\n        return cls(flights)\n\n@dataclass\nclass TravelPlan(DataClassDictMixin):\n    budget: float\n    itinerary: Itinerary\n\ninput_data = {\n    \"budget\": 10_000,\n    \"itinerary\": [\n        {\n            \"origin\": [\"JFK\", \"New York City\"],\n            \"destination\": [\"LAX\", \"Los Angeles\"]\n        },\n        {\n            \"origin\": [\"LAX\", \"Los Angeles\"],\n            \"destination\": [\"SFO\", \"San Fransisco\"]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nIf we pass the flight list as is into `Itinerary._deserialize`, our itinerary\nwill have something that we may not expect — `list[dict]` instead of\n`list[Flight]`. The solution is quite simple. Instead of calling\n`Flight._deserialize` yourself, just use annotations:\n\n```python\nclass Itinerary(SerializableType, use_annotations=True):\n    def __init__(self, flights):\n        self.flights = flights\n\n    def _serialize(self) -> list[Flight]:\n        return self.flights\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _deserialize(cls, flights: list[Flight]):\n        return cls(flights)\n\nmy_plan = TravelPlan.from_dict(input_data)\nassert isinstance(my_plan.itinerary.flights[0], Flight)\nassert isinstance(my_plan.itinerary.flights[1], Flight)\nassert my_plan.to_dict() == input_data\n```\n\nHere we add annotations to the only argument of `_deserialize` method and\nto the return value of `_serialize` method as well. The latter is needed for\ncorrect serialization.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> The importance of explicit passing `use_annotations=True` when defining a\n> class is that otherwise implicit using annotations might break compatibility\n> with old code that wasn't aware of this feature. It will be enabled by\n> default in the future major release.\n\n#### User-defined generic types\n\nThe great thing to note about using annotations in `SerializableType` is that\nthey work seamlessly with [generic](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#user-defined-generic-types)\nand [variadic generic](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/) types.\nLet's see how this can be useful:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom typing import TypeVar\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializableType\n\nKT = TypeVar(\"KT\")\nVT = TypeVar(\"VT\")\n\nclass DictWrapper(dict[KT, VT], SerializableType, use_annotations=True):\n    def _serialize(self) -> dict[KT, VT]:\n        return dict(self)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _deserialize(cls, value: dict[KT, VT]) -> 'DictWrapper[KT, VT]':\n        return cls(value)\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: DictWrapper[date, str]\n    y: DictWrapper[str, date]\n\ninput_data = {\n    \"x\": {\"2022-12-07\": \"2022-12-07\"},\n    \"y\": {\"2022-12-07\": \"2022-12-07\"}\n}\nobj = DataClass.from_dict(input_data)\nassert obj == DataClass(\n    x=DictWrapper({date(2022, 12, 7): \"2022-12-07\"}),\n    y=DictWrapper({\"2022-12-07\": date(2022, 12, 7)})\n)\nassert obj.to_dict() == input_data\n```\n\nYou can see that formatted date is deserialized to `date` object before passing\nto `DictWrapper._deserialize` in a key or value according to the generic\nparameters.\n\nIf you have generic dataclass types, you can use `SerializableType` for them as well, but it's not necessary since\nthey're [supported](#generic-dataclasses) out of the box.\n\n### SerializationStrategy\n\nIf you want to add support for a custom third-party type that is not under your control,\nyou can write serialization and deserialization logic inside `SerializationStrategy` class,\nwhich will be reusable and so well suited in case that third-party type is widely used.\n`SerializationStrategy` is also good if you want to create strategies that are slightly different from each other,\nbecause you can add the strategy differentiator in the `__init__` method.\n\n#### Third-party types\n\nTo demonstrate how `SerializationStrategy` works let's write a simple strategy for datetime serialization\nin different formats. In this example we will use the same strategy class for two dataclass fields,\nbut a string representing the date and time will be different.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin, field_options\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializationStrategy\n\nclass FormattedDateTime(SerializationStrategy):\n    def __init__(self, fmt):\n        self.fmt = fmt\n\n    def serialize(self, value: datetime) -> str:\n        return value.strftime(self.fmt)\n\n    def deserialize(self, value: str) -> datetime:\n        return datetime.strptime(value, self.fmt)\n\n@dataclass\nclass DateTimeFormats(DataClassDictMixin):\n    short: datetime = field(\n        metadata=field_options(\n            serialization_strategy=FormattedDateTime(\"%d%m%Y%H%M%S\")\n        )\n    )\n    verbose: datetime = field(\n        metadata=field_options(\n            serialization_strategy=FormattedDateTime(\"%A %B %d, %Y, %H:%M:%S\")\n        )\n    )\n\nformats = DateTimeFormats(\n    short=datetime(2019, 1, 1, 12),\n    verbose=datetime(2019, 1, 1, 12),\n)\ndictionary = formats.to_dict()\n# {'short': '01012019120000', 'verbose': 'Tuesday January 01, 2019, 12:00:00'}\nassert DateTimeFormats.from_dict(dictionary) == formats\n```\n\nSimilarly to `SerializableType`, `SerializationStrategy` could also take advantage of annotations:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializationStrategy\n\nclass TsSerializationStrategy(SerializationStrategy, use_annotations=True):\n    def serialize(self, value: datetime) -> float:\n        return value.timestamp()\n\n    def deserialize(self, value: float) -> datetime:\n        # value will be converted to float before being passed to this method\n        return datetime.fromtimestamp(value)\n\n@dataclass\nclass Example(DataClassDictMixin):\n    dt: datetime\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            datetime: TsSerializationStrategy(),\n        }\n\nexample = Example.from_dict({\"dt\": \"1672531200\"})\nprint(example)\n# Example(dt=datetime.datetime(2023, 1, 1, 3, 0))\nprint(example.to_dict())\n# {'dt': 1672531200.0}\n```\n\nHere the passed string value `\"1672531200\"` will be converted to `float` before being passed to `deserialize` method\nthanks to the `float` annotation.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> As well as for `SerializableType`, the value of `use_annotatons` will be\n> `True` by default in the future major release.\n\n#### Third-party generic types\n\nTo create a generic version of a serialization strategy you need to follow these steps:\n* inherit [`Generic[...]`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic) type\nwith the number of parameters matching the number of parameters\nof the target generic type\n* Write generic annotations for `serialize` method's return type and for `deserialize` method's argument type\n* Use the origin type of the target generic type in the [`serialization_strategy`](#serialization_strategy-config-option) config section\n([`typing.get_origin`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.get_origin) might be helpful)\n\nThere is no need to add `use_annotations=True` here because it's enabled implicitly\nfor generic serialization strategies.\n\nFor example, there is a third-party [multidict](https://pypi.org/project/multidict/) package that has a generic `MultiDict` type.\nA generic serialization strategy for it might look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom pprint import pprint\nfrom typing import Generic, List, Tuple, TypeVar\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializationStrategy\n\nfrom multidict import MultiDict\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\nclass MultiDictSerializationStrategy(SerializationStrategy, Generic[T]):\n    def serialize(self, value: MultiDict[T]) -> List[Tuple[str, T]]:\n        return [(k, v) for k, v in value.items()]\n\n    def deserialize(self, value: List[Tuple[str, T]]) -> MultiDict[T]:\n        return MultiDict(value)\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass Example(DataClassDictMixin):\n    floats: MultiDict[float]\n    date_lists: MultiDict[List[date]]\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            MultiDict: MultiDictSerializationStrategy()\n        }\n\nexample = Example(\n    floats=MultiDict([(\"x\", 1.1), (\"x\", 2.2)]),\n    date_lists=MultiDict(\n        [(\"x\", [date(2023, 1, 1), date(2023, 1, 2)]),\n         (\"x\", [date(2023, 2, 1), date(2023, 2, 2)])]\n    ),\n)\npprint(example.to_dict())\n# {'date_lists': [['x', ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02']],\n#                 ['x', ['2023-02-01', '2023-02-02']]],\n#  'floats': [['x', 1.1], ['x', 2.2]]}\nassert Example.from_dict(example.to_dict()) == example\n```\n\n### Field options\n\nIn some cases creating a new class just for one little thing could be\nexcessive. Moreover, you may need to deal with third party classes that you are\nnot allowed to change. You can use [`dataclasses.field`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.field) function to\nconfigure some serialization aspects through its `metadata` parameter. Next\nsection describes all supported options to use in `metadata` mapping.\n\nIf you don't want to remember the names of the options you can use\n`field_options` helper function:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import field_options\n\n@dataclass\nclass A:\n    x: int = field(metadata=field_options(...))\n```\n\n#### `serialize` option\n\nThis option allows you to change the serialization method. When using\nthis option, the serialization behaviour depends on what type of value the\noption has. It could be either `Callable[[Any], Any]` or `str`.\n\nA value of type `Callable[[Any], Any]` is a generic way to specify any callable\nobject like a function, a class method, a class instance method, an instance\nof a callable class or even a lambda function to be called for serialization.\n\nA value of type `str` sets a specific engine for serialization. Keep in mind\nthat all possible engines depend on the data type that this option is used\nwith. At this moment there are next serialization engines to choose from:\n\n| Applicable data types      | Supported engines    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|:---------------------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `NamedTuple`, `namedtuple` | `as_list`, `as_dict` | How to pack named tuples.

You can register `serialize` and `deserialize` methods, define\ncode generation options and other things just in one place. Or in some\nclasses in different ways if you need flexibility. Inheritance is always on the\nfirst place.\n\nThere is a base class `BaseConfig` that you can inherit for the sake of\nconvenience, but it's not mandatory.\n\nIn the following example you can see how\nthe `debug` flag is changed from class to class: `ModelA` will have debug mode enabled but\n`ModelB` will not.\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\nclass BaseModel(DataClassDictMixin):\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        debug = True\n\nclass ModelA(BaseModel):\n    a: int\n\nclass ModelB(BaseModel):\n    b: int\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        debug = False\n```\n\nNext section describes all supported options to use in the config.\n\n#### `debug` config option\n\nIf you enable the `debug` option the generated code for your data class\nwill be printed.\n\n#### `code_generation_options` config option\n\nSome users may need functionality that wouldn't exist without extra cost such\nas valuable cpu time to execute additional instructions. Since not everyone\nneeds such instructions, they can be enabled by a constant in the list,\nso the fastest basic behavior of the library will always remain by default.\nThe following table provides a brief overview of all the available constants\ndescribed below.\n\n| Constant                                                        | Description                                                          |\n|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [`TO_DICT_ADD_OMIT_NONE_FLAG`](#add-omit_none-keyword-argument) | Adds `omit_none` keyword-only argument to `to_*` methods.            |\n| [`TO_DICT_ADD_BY_ALIAS_FLAG`](#add-by_alias-keyword-argument)   | Adds `by_alias` keyword-only argument to `to_*` methods.             |\n| [`ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT`](#add-dialect-keyword-argument)          | Adds `dialect` keyword-only argument to `from_*` and `to_*` methods. |\n| [`ADD_SERIALIZATION_CONTEXT`](#add-context-keyword-argument)    | Adds `context` keyword-only argument to `to_*` methods.              |\n\n#### `serialization_strategy` config option\n\nYou can register custom [`SerializationStrategy`](#serializationstrategy), `serialize` and `deserialize`\nmethods for specific types just in one place. It could be configured using\na dictionary with types as keys. The value could be either a\n[`SerializationStrategy`](#serializationstrategy) instance or a dictionary with `serialize` and\n`deserialize` values with the same meaning as in the\n[field options](#field-options).\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import datetime, date\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializationStrategy\n\nclass FormattedDateTime(SerializationStrategy):\n    def __init__(self, fmt):\n        self.fmt = fmt\n\n    def serialize(self, value: datetime) -> str:\n        return value.strftime(self.fmt)\n\n    def deserialize(self, value: str) -> datetime:\n        return datetime.strptime(value, self.fmt)\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n\n    x: datetime\n    y: date\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            datetime: FormattedDateTime(\"%Y\"),\n            date: {\n                # you can use specific str values for datetime here as well\n                \"deserialize\": \"pendulum\",\n                \"serialize\": date.isoformat,\n            },\n        }\n\ninstance = DataClass.from_dict({\"x\": \"2021\", \"y\": \"2021\"})\n# DataClass(x=datetime.datetime(2021, 1, 1, 0, 0), y=Date(2021, 1, 1))\ndictionary = instance.to_dict()\n# {'x': '2021', 'y': '2021-01-01'}\n```\n\nNote that you can register different methods for multiple logical types which\nare based on the same type using `NewType` and `Annotated`,\nsee [Extending existing types](#extending-existing-types) for details.\n\nIt's also possible to define a generic (de)serialization method for a generic\ntype by registering a method for its\n[origin](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.get_origin) type.\nAlthough this technique is widely used when working with [third-party generic\ntypes](#third-party-generic-types) using generic strategies, it can also be\napplied in simple scenarios:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass C(DataClassDictMixin):\n    ints: list[int]\n    floats: list[float]\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            list: {  # origin type for list[int] and list[float] is list\n                \"serialize\": lambda x: list(map(str, x)),\n            }\n        }\n\nassert C([1], [2.2]).to_dict() == {'ints': ['1'], 'floats': ['2.2']}\n```\n\n#### `aliases` config option\n\nSometimes it's better to write the [field aliases](#field-aliases) in one place. You can mix\naliases here with [aliases in the field options](#alias-option), but the last ones will always\ntake precedence.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    a: int\n    b: int\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        aliases = {\n            \"a\": \"FieldA\",\n            \"b\": \"FieldB\",\n        }\n\nDataClass.from_dict({\"FieldA\": 1, \"FieldB\": 2})  # DataClass(a=1, b=2)\n```\n\n#### `serialize_by_alias` config option\n\nAll the fields with [aliases](#field-aliases) will be serialized by them by\ndefault when this option is enabled. You can mix this config option with\n[`by_alias`](#add-by_alias-keyword-argument) keyword argument.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin, field_options\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    field_a: int = field(metadata=field_options(alias=\"FieldA\"))\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        serialize_by_alias = True\n\nDataClass(field_a=1).to_dict()  # {'FieldA': 1}\n```\n\n#### `allow_deserialization_not_by_alias` config option\n\nWhen using aliases, the deserializer defaults to requiring the keys to match\nwhat is defined as the alias.\nIf the flexibility to deserialize aliased and unaliased keys is required then\nthe config option `allow_deserialization_not_by_alias ` can be set to\nenable the feature.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass AliasedDataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    foo: int = field(metadata={\"alias\": \"alias_foo\"})\n    bar: int = field(metadata={\"alias\": \"alias_bar\"})\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        allow_deserialization_not_by_alias = True\n\n\nalias_dict = {\"alias_foo\": 1, \"alias_bar\": 2}\nt1 = AliasedDataClass.from_dict(alias_dict)\n\nno_alias_dict = {\"foo\": 1, \"bar\": 2}\n# This would raise `mashumaro.exceptions.MissingField`\n# if allow_deserialization_not_by_alias was False\nt2 = AliasedDataClass.from_dict(no_alias_dict)\nassert t1 == t2\n```\n\n#### `omit_none` config option\n\nAll the fields with `None` values will be skipped during serialization by\ndefault when this option is enabled. You can mix this config option with\n[`omit_none`](#add-omit_none-keyword-argument) keyword argument.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: Optional[int] = 42\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        omit_none = True\n\nDataClass(x=None).to_dict()  # {}\n```\n\n#### `omit_default` config option\n\nWhen this option enabled, all the fields that have values equal to the defaults\nor the default_factory results will be skipped during serialization.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import List, Optional, Tuple\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin, field_options\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass Foo:\n    foo: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    a: int = 42\n    b: Tuple[int, ...] = field(default=(1, 2, 3))\n    c: List[Foo] = field(default_factory=lambda: [Foo(\"foo\")])\n    d: Optional[str] = None\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        omit_default = True\n\nDataClass(a=42, b=(1, 2, 3), c=[Foo(\"foo\")]).to_dict()  # {}\n```\n\n#### `namedtuple_as_dict` config option\n\nDataclasses are a great way to declare and use data models. But it's not the only way.\nPython has a typed version of [namedtuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)\ncalled [NamedTuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)\nwhich looks similar to dataclasses:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import NamedTuple\n\nclass Point(NamedTuple):\n    x: int\n    y: int\n```\n\nthe same with a dataclass will look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Point:\n    x: int\n    y: int\n```\n\nAt first glance, you can use both options. But imagine that you need to create\na bunch of instances of the `Point` class. Due to how dataclasses work you will\nhave more memory consumption compared to named tuples. In such a case it could\nbe more appropriate to use named tuples.\n\nBy default, all named tuples are packed into lists. But with `namedtuple_as_dict`\noption you have a drop-in replacement for dataclasses:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import List, NamedTuple\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\nclass Point(NamedTuple):\n    x: int\n    y: int\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    points: List[Point]\n\n    class Config:\n        namedtuple_as_dict = True\n\nobj = DataClass.from_dict({\"points\": [{\"x\": 0, \"y\": 0}, {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 1}]})\nprint(obj.to_dict())  # {\"points\": [{\"x\": 0, \"y\": 0}, {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 1}]}\n```\n\nIf you want to serialize only certain named tuple fields as dictionaries, you\ncan use the corresponding [serialization](#serialize-option) and\n[deserialization](#deserialize-option) engines.\n\n#### `allow_postponed_evaluation` config option\n\n[PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) solved the problem of forward references by postponing the evaluation\nof annotations, so you can write the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: B\n\n@dataclass\nclass B(DataClassDictMixin):\n    y: int\n\nobj = A.from_dict({'x': {'y': 1}})\n```\n\nYou don't need to write anything special here, forward references work out of\nthe box. If a field of a dataclass has a forward reference in the type\nannotations, building of `from_*` and `to_*` methods of this dataclass\nwill be postponed until they are called once. However, if for some reason you\ndon't want the evaluation to be possibly postponed, you can disable it using\n`allow_postponed_evaluation` option:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: B\n\n    class Config:\n        allow_postponed_evaluation = False\n\n# UnresolvedTypeReferenceError: Class A has unresolved type reference B\n# in some of its fields\n\n@dataclass\nclass B(DataClassDictMixin):\n    y: int\n```\n\nIn this case you will get `UnresolvedTypeReferenceError` regardless of whether\nclass B is declared below or not.\n\n#### `dialect` config option\n\nThis option is described [below](#changing-the-default-dialect) in the\nDialects section.\n\n#### `orjson_options` config option\n\nThis option changes default options for `orjson.dumps` encoder which is\nused in [`DataClassORJSONMixin`](#dataclassorjsonmixin). For example, you can\ntell orjson to handle non-`str` `dict` keys as the built-in `json.dumps`\nencoder does. See [orjson documentation](https://github.com/ijl/orjson#option)\nto read more about these options.\n\n```python\nimport orjson\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Dict\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.mixins.orjson import DataClassORJSONMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyClass(DataClassORJSONMixin):\n    x: Dict[int, int]\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        orjson_options = orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS\n\nassert MyClass({1: 2}).to_json() == {\"1\": 2}\n```\n\n#### `discriminator` config option\n\nThis option is described in the\n[Class level discriminator](#class-level-discriminator) section.\n\n#### `lazy_compilation` config option\n\nBy using this option, the compilation of the `from_*` and `to_*` methods will\nbe deferred until they are called first time. This will reduce the import time\nand, in certain instances, may enhance the speed of deserialization\nby leveraging the data that is accessible after the class has been created.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\\\n> If you need to save a reference to `from_*` or `to_*` method, you should\n> do it after the method is compiled. To be safe, you can always use lambda\n> function:\n> ```python\n> from_dict = lambda x: MyModel.from_dict(x)\n> to_dict = lambda x: x.to_dict()\n> ```\n\n#### `sort_keys` config option\n\nWhen set, the keys on serialized dataclasses will be sorted in alphabetical order.\n\nUnlike the `sort_keys` option in the standard library's `json.dumps` function, this option acts at class creation time and has no effect on the performance of serialization.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass SortedDataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    foo: int\n    bar: int\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        sort_keys = True\n\nt = SortedDataClass(1, 2)\nassert t.to_dict() == {\"bar\": 2, \"foo\": 1}\n```\n\n#### `forbid_extra_keys` config option\n\nWhen set, the deserialization of dataclasses will fail if the input dictionary contains keys that are not present in the dataclass.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    a: int\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        forbid_extra_keys = True\n\nDataClass.from_dict({\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2})  # ExtraKeysError: Extra keys: {'b'}\n```\n\nIt plays well with `aliases` and `allow_deserialization_not_by_alias` options.\n\n### Passing field values as is\n\nIn some cases it's needed to pass a field value as is without any changes\nduring serialization / deserialization. There is a predefined\n[`pass_through`](https://github.com/Fatal1ty/mashumaro/blob/master/mashumaro/helper.py#L58)\nobject that can be used as `serialization_strategy` or\n`serialize` / `deserialize` options:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin, pass_through\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, some_value):\n        self.some_value = some_value\n\n@dataclass\nclass A1(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: MyClass = field(\n        metadata={\n            \"serialize\": pass_through,\n            \"deserialize\": pass_through,\n        }\n    )\n\n@dataclass\nclass A2(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: MyClass = field(\n        metadata={\n            \"serialization_strategy\": pass_through,\n        }\n    )\n\n@dataclass\nclass A3(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: MyClass\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            MyClass: pass_through,\n        }\n\n@dataclass\nclass A4(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: MyClass\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            MyClass: {\n                \"serialize\": pass_through,\n                \"deserialize\": pass_through,\n            }\n        }\n\nmy_class_instance = MyClass(42)\n\nassert A1.from_dict({'x': my_class_instance}).x == my_class_instance\nassert A2.from_dict({'x': my_class_instance}).x == my_class_instance\nassert A3.from_dict({'x': my_class_instance}).x == my_class_instance\nassert A4.from_dict({'x': my_class_instance}).x == my_class_instance\n\na1_dict = A1(my_class_instance).to_dict()\na2_dict = A2(my_class_instance).to_dict()\na3_dict = A3(my_class_instance).to_dict()\na4_dict = A4(my_class_instance).to_dict()\n\nassert a1_dict == a2_dict == a3_dict == a4_dict == {\"x\": my_class_instance}\n```\n\n### Extending existing types\n\nThere are situations where you might want some values of the same type to be\ntreated as their own type. You can create new logical types with\n[`NewType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#newtype),\n[`Annotated`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated)\nor [`TypeAliasType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeAliasType)\nand register serialization strategies for them:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Mapping, NewType, Annotated\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\nSessionID = NewType(\"SessionID\", str)\nAccountID = Annotated[str, \"AccountID\"]\n\ntype DeviceID = str\n\n@dataclass\nclass Context(DataClassDictMixin):\n    account_sessions: Mapping[AccountID, SessionID]\n    account_devices: list[DeviceID]\n\n    class Config:\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            AccountID: {\n                \"deserialize\": lambda x: ...,\n                \"serialize\": lambda x: ...,\n            },\n            SessionID: {\n                \"deserialize\": lambda x: ...,\n                \"serialize\": lambda x: ...,\n            },\n            DeviceID: {\n                \"deserialize\": lambda x: ...,\n                \"serialize\": lambda x: ...,\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nAlthough using `NewType` is usually the most reliable way to avoid logical\nerrors, you have to pay for it with notable overhead. If you are creating\ndataclass instances manually, then you know that type checkers will\nenforce you to enclose a value in your `\"NewType\"` callable, which leads\nto performance degradation:\n\n```python\npython -m timeit -s \"from typing import NewType; MyInt = NewType('MyInt', int)\" \"MyInt(42)\"\n10000000 loops, best of 5: 31.1 nsec per loop\n\npython -m timeit -s \"from typing import NewType; MyInt = NewType('MyInt', int)\" \"42\"\n50000000 loops, best of 5: 4.35 nsec per loop\n```\n\nHowever, when you create dataclass instances using the `from_*` method provided\nby one of the mixins or using one of the decoders, there will be no performance\ndegradation, because the value won't be enclosed in the callable in the\ngenerated code. Therefore, if performance is more important to you than\ncatching logical errors by type checkers, and you are actively creating or\nchanging dataclasses manually, then you should take a closer look at using\n`Annotated`.\n\n### Field aliases\n\nIn some cases it's better to have different names for a field in your dataclass\nand in its serialized view. For example, a third-party legacy API you are\nworking with might operate with camel case style, but you stick to snake case\nstyle in your code base. Or you want to load data with keys that are\ninvalid identifiers in Python. Aliases can solve this problem.\n\nThere are multiple ways to assign an alias:\n* Using `Alias(...)` annotation in a field type\n* Using `alias` parameter in field metadata\n* Using `aliases` parameter in a dataclass config\n\nBy default, aliases only affect deserialization, but it can be extended to\nserialization as well. If you want to serialize all the fields by aliases you\nhave two options to do so:\n* [`serialize_by_alias` config option](#serialize_by_alias-config-option)\n* [`serialize_by_alias` dialect option](#serialize_by_alias-dialect-option)\n* [`by_alias` keyword argument in `to_*` methods](#add-by_alias-keyword-argument)\n\nHere is an example with `Alias` annotation in a field type:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import Alias\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    foo_bar: Annotated[int, Alias(\"fooBar\")]\n\nobj = DataClass.from_dict({\"fooBar\": 42})  # DataClass(foo_bar=42)\nobj.to_dict()  # {\"foo_bar\": 42}  # no aliases on serialization by default\n```\n\nThe same with field metadata:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import field_options\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass:\n    foo_bar: str = field(metadata=field_options(alias=\"fooBar\"))\n```\n\nAnd with a dataclass config:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass:\n    foo_bar: str\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        aliases = {\"foo_bar\": \"fooBar\"}\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\\\n> If you want to deserialize all the fields by its names along with aliases,\n> there is [a config option](#allow_deserialization_not_by_alias-config-option)\n> for that.\n\n### Dialects\n\nSometimes it's needed to have different serialization and deserialization\nmethods depending on the data source where entities of the dataclass are\nstored or on the API to which the entities are being sent or received from.\nThere is a special `Dialect` type that may contain all the differences from the\ndefault serialization and deserialization methods. You can create different\ndialects and use each of them for the same dataclass depending on\nthe situation.\n\nSuppose we have the following dataclass with a field of type `date`:\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Entity(DataClassDictMixin):\n    dt: date\n```\n\nBy default, a field of `date` type serializes to a string in ISO 8601 format,\nso the serialized entity will look like `{'dt': '2021-12-31'}`. But what if we\nhave, for example, two sensitive legacy Ethiopian and Japanese APIs that use\ntwo different formats for dates — `dd/mm/yyyy` and `yyyy年mm月dd日`? Instead of\ncreating two similar dataclasses we can have one dataclass and two dialects:\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date, datetime\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT\nfrom mashumaro.dialect import Dialect\nfrom mashumaro.types import SerializationStrategy\n\nclass DateTimeSerializationStrategy(SerializationStrategy):\n    def __init__(self, fmt: str):\n        self.fmt = fmt\n\n    def serialize(self, value: date) -> str:\n        return value.strftime(self.fmt)\n\n    def deserialize(self, value: str) -> date:\n        return datetime.strptime(value, self.fmt).date()\n\nclass EthiopianDialect(Dialect):\n    serialization_strategy = {\n        date: DateTimeSerializationStrategy(\"%d/%m/%Y\")\n    }\n\nclass JapaneseDialect(Dialect):\n    serialization_strategy = {\n        date: DateTimeSerializationStrategy(\"%Y年%m月%d日\")\n    }\n\n@dataclass\nclass Entity(DataClassDictMixin):\n    dt: date\n\n    class Config:\n        code_generation_options = [ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT]\n\nentity = Entity(date(2021, 12, 31))\nentity.to_dict(dialect=EthiopianDialect)  # {'dt': '31/12/2021'}\nentity.to_dict(dialect=JapaneseDialect)   # {'dt': '2021年12月31日'}\nEntity.from_dict({'dt': '2021年12月31日'}, dialect=JapaneseDialect)\n```\n\n#### `serialization_strategy` dialect option\n\nThis dialect option has the same meaning as the\n[similar config option](#serialization_strategy-config-option)\nbut for the dialect scope. You can register custom [`SerializationStrategy`](#serializationstrategy),\n`serialize` and `deserialize` methods for the specific types.\n\n#### `serialize_by_alias` dialect option\n\nThis dialect option has the same meaning as the\n[similar config option](#serialize_by_alias-config-option)\nbut for the dialect scope.\n\n#### `omit_none` dialect option\n\nThis dialect option has the same meaning as the\n[similar config option](#omit_none-config-option) but for the dialect scope.\n\n#### `omit_default` dialect option\n\nThis dialect option has the same meaning as the\n[similar config option](#omitdefault-config-option) but for the dialect scope.\n\n#### `namedtuple_as_dict` dialect option\n\nThis dialect option has the same meaning as the\n[similar config option](#namedtuple_as_dict-config-option)\nbut for the dialect scope.\n\n#### `no_copy_collections` dialect option\n\nBy default, all collection data types are serialized as a copy to prevent\nmutation of the original collection. As an example, if a dataclass contains\na field of type `list[str]`, then it will be serialized as a copy of the\noriginal list, so you can safely mutate it after. The downside is that copying\nis always slower than using a reference to the original collection. In some\ncases we know beforehand that mutation doesn't take place or is even desirable,\nso we can benefit from avoiding unnecessary copies by setting\n`no_copy_collections` to a sequence of origin collection data types.\nThis is applicable only for collections containing elements that do not\nrequire conversion.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.dialect import Dialect\n\nclass NoCopyDialect(Dialect):\n    no_copy_collections = (list, dict, set)\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    simple_list: list[str]\n    simple_dict: dict[str, str]\n    simple_set: set[str]\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        dialect = NoCopyDialect\n\nobj = DataClass([\"foo\"], {\"bar\": \"baz\"}, {\"foobar\"})\ndata = obj.to_dict()\n\nassert data[\"simple_list\"] is obj.simple_list\nassert data[\"simple_dict\"] is obj.simple_dict\nassert data[\"simple_set\"] is obj.simple_set\n```\n\nThis option is enabled for `list` and `dict` in the default dialects that\nbelong to mixins and codecs for the following formats:\n* [JSON (orjson library)](#orjson-library)\n* [TOML](#toml)\n* [MessagePack](#messagepack)\n\n#### Changing the default dialect\n\nYou can change the default serialization and deserialization methods not only\nin the [`serialization_strategy`](#serialization_strategy-config-option) config\noption but also using the `dialect` config option. If you have multiple\ndataclasses without a common parent class the default dialect can help you\nto reduce the number of code lines written:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Entity(DataClassDictMixin):\n    dt: date\n\n    class Config:\n        dialect = JapaneseDialect\n\nentity = Entity(date(2021, 12, 31))\nentity.to_dict()  # {'dt': '2021年12月31日'}\nassert Entity.from_dict({'dt': '2021年12月31日'}) == entity\n```\n\nDefault dialect can also be set when using codecs:\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.codecs import BasicDecoder, BasicEncoder\n\n@dataclass\nclass Entity:\n    dt: date\n\ndecoder = BasicDecoder(Entity, default_dialect=JapaneseDialect)\nencoder = BasicEncoder(Entity, default_dialect=JapaneseDialect)\n\nentity = Entity(date(2021, 12, 31))\nencoder.encode(entity) # {'dt': '2021年12月31日'}\nassert decoder.decode({'dt': '2021年12月31日'}) == entity\n```\n\n### Discriminator\n\nThere is a special `Discriminator` class that allows you to customize how\na union of dataclasses or their hierarchy will be deserialized.\nIt has the following parameters that affects class selection rules:\n\n* `field` — optional name of the input dictionary key (also known as tag)\n  by which all the variants can be distinguished\n* `include_subtypes` — allow to deserialize subclasses\n* `include_supertypes` — allow to deserialize superclasses\n* `variant_tagger_fn` — a custom function used to generate tag values\n  associated with a variant\n\nBy default, each variant that you want to discriminate by tags should have a\nclass-level attribute containing an associated tag value. This attribute should\nhave a name defined by `field` parameter. The tag value coule be in the\nfollowing forms:\n\n* without annotations: `type = 42`\n* annotated as ClassVar: `type: ClassVar[int] = 42`\n* annotated as Final: `type: Final[int] = 42`\n* annotated as Literal: `type: Literal[42] = 42`\n* annotated as StrEnum: `type: ResponseType = ResponseType.OK`\n\n> [!NOTE]\\\n> Keep in mind that by default only Final, Literal and StrEnum fields are\n> processed during serialization.\n\nHowever, it is possible to use discriminator without the class-level\nattribute. You can provide a custom function that generates one or many variant\ntag values. This function should take a class as the only argument and return\neither a single value of the basic type like `str` or `int` or a list of them\nto associate multiple tags with a variant. The common practice is to use\na class name as a single tag value:\n\n```python\nvariant_tagger_fn = lambda cls: cls.__name__\n```\n\nNext, we will look at different use cases, as well as their pros and cons.\n\n#### Subclasses distinguishable by a field\n\nOften you have a base dataclass and multiple subclasses that are easily\ndistinguishable from each other by the value of a particular field.\nFor example, there may be different events, messages or requests with\na discriminator field \"event_type\", \"message_type\" or just \"type\". You could've\nlisted all of them within `Union` type, but it would be too verbose and\nimpractical. Moreover, deserialization of the union would be slow, since we\nneed to iterate over each variant in the list until we find the right one.\n\nWe can improve subclass deserialization using `Discriminator` as annotation\nwithin `Annotated` type. We will use `field` parameter and set\n`include_subtypes` to `True`.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> The discriminator field should be accessible from the `__dict__` attribute\n> of a specific descendant, i.e. defined at the level of that descendant.\n> A descendant class without a discriminator field will be ignored, but\n> its descendants won't.\n\nSuppose we have a hierarchy of client events distinguishable by a class\nattribute \"type\":\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom ipaddress import IPv4Address\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientEvent(DataClassDictMixin):\n    pass\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientConnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    type = \"connected\"\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientDisconnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    type = \"disconnected\"\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n```\n\nWe use base dataclass `ClientEvent` for a field of another dataclass:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Annotated, List\n# or from typing_extensions import Annotated\nfrom mashumaro.types import Discriminator\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass AggregatedEvents(DataClassDictMixin):\n    list: List[\n        Annotated[\n            ClientEvent, Discriminator(field=\"type\", include_subtypes=True)\n        ]\n    ]\n```\n\nNow we can deserialize events based on \"type\" value:\n\n```python\nevents = AggregatedEvents.from_dict(\n    {\n        \"list\": [\n            {\"type\": \"connected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"},\n            {\"type\": \"disconnected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"},\n        ]\n    }\n)\nassert events == AggregatedEvents(\n    list=[\n        ClientConnectedEvent(client_ip=IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\")),\n        ClientDisconnectedEvent(client_ip=IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\")),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n#### Subclasses without a common field\n\nIn rare cases you have to deal with subclasses that don't have a common field\nname which they can be distinguished by. Since `Discriminator` can be\ninitialized without \"field\" parameter you can use it with only\n`include_subclasses` enabled. The drawback is that we will have to go through all\nthe subclasses until we find the suitable one. It's almost like using `Union`\ntype but with subclasses support.\n\nSuppose we're making a brunch. We have some ingredients:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Ingredient(DataClassDictMixin):\n    name: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass Hummus(Ingredient):\n    made_of: Literal[\"chickpeas\", \"beet\", \"artichoke\"]\n    grams: int\n\n@dataclass\nclass Celery(Ingredient):\n    pieces: int\n```\n\nLet's create a plate:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Plate(DataClassDictMixin):\n    ingredients: List[\n        Annotated[Ingredient, Discriminator(include_subtypes=True)]\n    ]\n```\n\nAnd now we can put our ingredients on the plate:\n\n```python\nplate = Plate.from_dict(\n    {\n        \"ingredients\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"hummus from the shop\",\n                \"made_of\": \"chickpeas\",\n                \"grams\": 150,\n            },\n            {\"name\": \"celery from my garden\", \"pieces\": 5},\n        ]\n    }\n)\nassert plate == Plate(\n    ingredients=[\n        Hummus(name=\"hummus from the shop\", made_of=\"chickpeas\", grams=150),\n        Celery(name=\"celery from my garden\", pieces=5),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nIn some cases it's necessary to fall back to the base class if there is no\nsuitable subclass. We can set `include_supertypes` to `True`:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Plate(DataClassDictMixin):\n    ingredients: List[\n        Annotated[\n            Ingredient,\n            Discriminator(include_subtypes=True, include_supertypes=True),\n        ]\n    ]\n\nplate = Plate.from_dict(\n    {\n        \"ingredients\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"hummus from the shop\",\n                \"made_of\": \"chickpeas\",\n                \"grams\": 150,\n            },\n            {\"name\": \"celery from my garden\", \"pieces\": 5},\n            {\"name\": \"cumin\"}  # <- new unknown ingredient\n        ]\n    }\n)\nassert plate == Plate(\n    ingredients=[\n        Hummus(name=\"hummus from the shop\", made_of=\"chickpeas\", grams=150),\n        Celery(name=\"celery from my garden\", pieces=5),\n        Ingredient(name=\"cumin\"),  # <- unknown ingredient added\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n#### Class level discriminator\n\nIt may often be more convenient to specify a `Discriminator` once at the class\nlevel and use that class without `Annotated` type for subclass deserialization.\nDepending on the `Discriminator` parameters, it can be used as a replacement for\n[subclasses distinguishable by a field](#subclasses-distinguishable-by-a-field)\nas well as for [subclasses without a common field](#subclasses-without-a-common-field).\nThe only difference is that you can't use `include_supertypes=True` because\nit would lead to a recursion error.\n\nReworked example will look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom ipaddress import IPv4Address\nfrom typing import List\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.types import Discriminator\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientEvent(DataClassDictMixin):\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        discriminator = Discriminator(  # <- add discriminator\n            field=\"type\",\n            include_subtypes=True,\n        )\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientConnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    type = \"connected\"\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientDisconnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    type = \"disconnected\"\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n\n@dataclass\nclass AggregatedEvents(DataClassDictMixin):\n    list: List[ClientEvent]  # <- use base class here\n```\n\nAnd now we can deserialize events based on \"type\" value as we did earlier:\n\n```python\nevents = AggregatedEvents.from_dict(\n    {\n        \"list\": [\n            {\"type\": \"connected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"},\n            {\"type\": \"disconnected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"},\n        ]\n    }\n)\nassert events == AggregatedEvents(\n    list=[\n        ClientConnectedEvent(client_ip=IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\")),\n        ClientDisconnectedEvent(client_ip=IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\")),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\nWhat's more interesting is that you can now deserialize subclasses simply by\ncalling the superclass `from_*` method, which is very useful:\n```python\ndisconnected_event = ClientEvent.from_dict(\n    {\"type\": \"disconnected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"}\n)\nassert disconnected_event == ClientDisconnectedEvent(IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\"))\n```\n\nThe same is applicable for subclasses without a common field:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Ingredient(DataClassDictMixin):\n    name: str\n\n    class Config:\n        discriminator = Discriminator(include_subtypes=True)\n\n...\n\ncelery = Ingredient.from_dict({\"name\": \"celery from my garden\", \"pieces\": 5})\nassert celery == Celery(name=\"celery from my garden\", pieces=5)\n```\n\n#### Working with union of classes\n\nDeserialization of union of types distinguishable by a particular field will\nbe much faster using `Discriminator` because there will be no traversal\nof all classes and an attempt to deserialize each of them.\nUsually this approach can be used when you have multiple classes without a\ncommon superclass or when you only need to deserialize some of the subclasses.\nIn the following example we will use `include_supertypes=True` to\ndeserialize two subclasses out of three:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, Union\n# or from typing_extensions import Annotated\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import Discriminator\n\n@dataclass\nclass Event(DataClassDictMixin):\n    pass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Event1(Event):\n    code: Literal[1] = 1\n    ...\n\n@dataclass\nclass Event2(Event):\n    code: Literal[2] = 2\n    ...\n\n@dataclass\nclass Event3(Event):\n    code: Literal[3] = 3\n    ...\n\n@dataclass\nclass Message(DataClassDictMixin):\n    event: Annotated[\n        Union[Event1, Event2],\n        Discriminator(field=\"code\", include_supertypes=True),\n    ]\n\nevent1_msg = Message.from_dict({\"event\": {\"code\": 1, ...}})\nevent2_msg = Message.from_dict({\"event\": {\"code\": 2, ...}})\nassert isinstance(event1_msg.event, Event1)\nassert isinstance(event2_msg.event, Event2)\n\n# raises InvalidFieldValue:\nMessage.from_dict({\"event\": {\"code\": 3, ...}})\n```\n\nAgain, it's not necessary to have a common superclass. If you have a union of\ndataclasses without a field that they can be distinguishable by, you can still\nuse `Discriminator`, but deserialization will almost be the same as for `Union`\ntype without `Discriminator` except that it could be possible to deserialize\nsubclasses with `include_subtypes=True`.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> When both `include_subtypes` and `include_supertypes` are enabled,\n> all subclasses will be attempted to be deserialized first,\n> superclasses — at the end.\n\nIn the following example you can see how priority works — first we try\nto deserialize `ChickpeaHummus`, and if it fails, then we try `Hummus`:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass Hummus(DataClassDictMixin):\n    made_of: Literal[\"chickpeas\", \"artichoke\"]\n    grams: int\n\n@dataclass\nclass ChickpeaHummus(Hummus):\n    made_of: Literal[\"chickpeas\"]\n\n@dataclass\nclass Celery(DataClassDictMixin):\n    pieces: int\n\n@dataclass\nclass Plate(DataClassDictMixin):\n    ingredients: List[\n        Annotated[\n            Union[Hummus, Celery],\n            Discriminator(include_subtypes=True, include_supertypes=True),\n        ]\n    ]\n\nplate = Plate.from_dict(\n    {\n        \"ingredients\": [\n            {\"made_of\": \"chickpeas\", \"grams\": 100},\n            {\"made_of\": \"artichoke\", \"grams\": 50},\n            {\"pieces\": 4},\n        ]\n    }\n)\nassert plate == Plate(\n    ingredients=[\n        ChickpeaHummus(made_of='chickpeas', grams=100),  # <- subclass\n        Hummus(made_of='artichoke', grams=50),  # <- superclass\n        Celery(pieces=4),\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n#### Using a custom variant tagger function\n\nSometimes it is impractical to have a class-level attribute with a tag value,\nespecially when you have a lot of classes. We can have a custom tagger\nfunction instead. This method is applicable for all scenarios of using\nthe discriminator, but for demonstration purposes, let's focus only on one\nof them.\n\nSuppose we want to use the middle part of `Client*Event` as a tag value:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom ipaddress import IPv4Address\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.types import Discriminator\n\n\ndef client_event_tagger(cls):\n    # not the best way of doing it, it's just a demo\n    return cls.__name__[6:-5].lower()\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientEvent(DataClassDictMixin):\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        discriminator = Discriminator(\n            field=\"type\",\n            include_subtypes=True,\n            variant_tagger_fn=client_event_tagger,\n        )\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientConnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n\n@dataclass\nclass ClientDisconnectedEvent(ClientEvent):\n    client_ip: IPv4Address\n```\n\nWe can now deserialize subclasses as we did it earlier\n[without variant tagger](#class-level-discriminator):\n```python\ndisconnected_event = ClientEvent.from_dict(\n    {\"type\": \"disconnected\", \"client_ip\": \"10.0.0.42\"}\n)\nassert disconnected_event == ClientDisconnectedEvent(IPv4Address(\"10.0.0.42\"))\n```\n\nIf we need to associate multiple tags with a single variant, we can return\na list of tags:\n\n```python\ndef client_event_tagger(cls):\n    name = cls.__name__[6:-5]\n    return [name.lower(), name.upper()]\n```\n\n### Code generation options\n\n#### Add `omit_none` keyword argument\n\nIf you want to have control over whether to skip `None` values on serialization\nyou can add `omit_none` parameter to `to_*` methods using the\n`code_generation_options` list. The default value of `omit_none`\nparameter depends on whether the [`omit_none`](#omit_none-config-option)\nconfig option or [`omit_none`](#omit_none-dialect-option) dialect option is enabled.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig, TO_DICT_ADD_OMIT_NONE_FLAG\n\n@dataclass\nclass Inner(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: int = None\n    # \"x\" won't be omitted since there is no TO_DICT_ADD_OMIT_NONE_FLAG here\n\n@dataclass\nclass Model(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: Inner\n    a: int = None\n    b: str = None  # will be omitted\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        code_generation_options = [TO_DICT_ADD_OMIT_NONE_FLAG]\n\nModel(x=Inner(), a=1).to_dict(omit_none=True)  # {'x': {'x': None}, 'a': 1}\n```\n\n#### Add `by_alias` keyword argument\n\nIf you want to have control over whether to serialize fields by their\n[aliases](#field-aliases) you can add `by_alias` parameter to `to_*` methods\nusing the `code_generation_options` list. The default value of `by_alias`\nparameter depends on whether the [`serialize_by_alias`](#serialize_by_alias-config-option)\nconfig option is enabled.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin, field_options\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig, TO_DICT_ADD_BY_ALIAS_FLAG\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    field_a: int = field(metadata=field_options(alias=\"FieldA\"))\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        code_generation_options = [TO_DICT_ADD_BY_ALIAS_FLAG]\n\nDataClass(field_a=1).to_dict()  # {'field_a': 1}\nDataClass(field_a=1).to_dict(by_alias=True)  # {'FieldA': 1}\n```\n\n#### Add `dialect` keyword argument\n\nSupport for [dialects](#dialects) is disabled by default for performance reasons. You can enable\nit using a `ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT` constant:\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig, ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT\n\n@dataclass\nclass Entity(DataClassDictMixin):\n    dt: date\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        code_generation_options = [ADD_DIALECT_SUPPORT]\n```\n\n#### Add `context` keyword argument\n\nSometimes it's needed to pass a \"context\" object to the serialization hooks\nthat will take it into account. For example, you could want to have an option\nto remove sensitive data from the serialization result if you need to.\nYou can add `context` parameter to `to_*` methods that will be passed to\n[`__pre_serialize__`](#before-serialization) and\n[`__post_serialize__`](#after-serialization) hooks. The type of this context\nas well as its mutability is up to you.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Dict, Optional\nfrom uuid import UUID\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig, ADD_SERIALIZATION_CONTEXT\n\nclass BaseModel(DataClassDictMixin):\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        code_generation_options = [ADD_SERIALIZATION_CONTEXT]\n\n@dataclass\nclass Account(BaseModel):\n    id: UUID\n    username: str\n    name: str\n\n    def __pre_serialize__(self, context: Optional[Dict] = None):\n        return self\n\n    def __post_serialize__(self, d: Dict, context: Optional[Dict] = None):\n        if context and context.get(\"remove_sensitive_data\"):\n            d[\"username\"] = \"***\"\n            d[\"name\"] = \"***\"\n        return d\n\n@dataclass\nclass Session(BaseModel):\n    id: UUID\n    key: str\n    account: Account\n\n    def __pre_serialize__(self, context: Optional[Dict] = None):\n        return self\n\n    def __post_serialize__(self, d: Dict, context: Optional[Dict] = None):\n        if context and context.get(\"remove_sensitive_data\"):\n            d[\"key\"] = \"***\"\n        return d\n\n\nfoo = Session(\n    id=UUID('03321c9f-6a97-421e-9869-918ff2867a71'),\n    key=\"VQ6Q9bX4c8s\",\n    account=Account(\n        id=UUID('4ef2baa7-edef-4d6a-b496-71e6d72c58fb'),\n        username=\"john_doe\",\n        name=\"John\"\n    )\n)\nassert foo.to_dict() == {\n    'id': '03321c9f-6a97-421e-9869-918ff2867a71',\n    'key': 'VQ6Q9bX4c8s',\n    'account': {\n        'id': '4ef2baa7-edef-4d6a-b496-71e6d72c58fb',\n        'username': 'john_doe',\n        'name': 'John'\n    }\n}\nassert foo.to_dict(context={\"remove_sensitive_data\": True}) == {\n    'id': '03321c9f-6a97-421e-9869-918ff2867a71',\n    'key': '***',\n    'account': {\n        'id': '4ef2baa7-edef-4d6a-b496-71e6d72c58fb',\n        'username': '***',\n        'name': '***'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Generic dataclasses\n\nAlong with [user-defined generic types](#user-defined-generic-types)\nimplementing `SerializableType` interface, generic and variadic\ngeneric dataclasses can also be used. There are two applicable scenarios\nfor them.\n\n#### Generic dataclass inheritance\n\nIf you have a generic dataclass and want to serialize and deserialize its\ninstances depending on the concrete types, you can use inheritance for that:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom typing import Generic, Mapping, TypeVar, TypeVarTuple\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\nKT = TypeVar(\"KT\")\nVT = TypeVar(\"VT\", date, str)\nTs = TypeVarTuple(\"Ts\")\n\n@dataclass\nclass GenericDataClass(Generic[KT, VT, *Ts]):\n    x: Mapping[KT, VT]\n    y: Tuple[*Ts, KT]\n\n@dataclass\nclass ConcreteDataClass(\n    GenericDataClass[str, date, *Tuple[float, ...]],\n    DataClassDictMixin,\n):\n    pass\n\nConcreteDataClass.from_dict({\"x\": {\"a\": \"2021-01-01\"}, \"y\": [1, 2, \"a\"]})\n# ConcreteDataClass(x={'a': datetime.date(2021, 1, 1)}, y=(1.0, 2.0, 'a'))\n```\n\nYou can override `TypeVar` field with a concrete type or another `TypeVar`.\nPartial specification of concrete types is also allowed. If a generic dataclass\nis inherited without type overriding the types of its fields remain untouched.\n\n#### Generic dataclass in a field type\n\nAnother approach is to specify concrete types in the field type hints. This can\nhelp to have different versions of the same generic dataclass:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeVar\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\n\nT = TypeVar('T')\n\n@dataclass\nclass GenericDataClass(Generic[T], DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: T\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    date: GenericDataClass[date]\n    str: GenericDataClass[str]\n\ninstance = DataClass(\n    date=GenericDataClass(x=date(2021, 1, 1)),\n    str=GenericDataClass(x='2021-01-01'),\n)\ndictionary = {'date': {'x': '2021-01-01'}, 'str': {'x': '2021-01-01'}}\nassert DataClass.from_dict(dictionary) == instance\n```\n\n### GenericSerializableType interface\n\nThere is a generic alternative to [`SerializableType`](#serializabletype-interface)\ncalled `GenericSerializableType`. It makes it possible to decide yourself how\nto serialize and deserialize input data depending on the types provided:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom typing import Dict, TypeVar\nfrom mashumaro import DataClassDictMixin\nfrom mashumaro.types import GenericSerializableType\n\nKT = TypeVar(\"KT\")\nVT = TypeVar(\"VT\")\n\nclass DictWrapper(Dict[KT, VT], GenericSerializableType):\n    __packers__ = {date: lambda x: x.isoformat(), str: str}\n    __unpackers__ = {date: date.fromisoformat, str: str}\n\n    def _serialize(self, types) -> Dict[KT, VT]:\n        k_type, v_type = types\n        k_conv = self.__packers__[k_type]\n        v_conv = self.__packers__[v_type]\n        return {k_conv(k): v_conv(v) for k, v in self.items()}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _deserialize(cls, value, types) -> \"DictWrapper[KT, VT]\":\n        k_type, v_type = types\n        k_conv = cls.__unpackers__[k_type]\n        v_conv = cls.__unpackers__[v_type]\n        return cls({k_conv(k): v_conv(v) for k, v in value.items()})\n\n@dataclass\nclass DataClass(DataClassDictMixin):\n    x: DictWrapper[date, str]\n    y: DictWrapper[str, date]\n\ninput_data = {\n    \"x\": {\"2022-12-07\": \"2022-12-07\"},\n    \"y\": {\"2022-12-07\": \"2022-12-07\"},\n}\nobj = DataClass.from_dict(input_data)\nassert obj == DataClass(\n    x=DictWrapper({date(2022, 12, 7): \"2022-12-07\"}),\n    y=DictWrapper({\"2022-12-07\": date(2022, 12, 7)}),\n)\nassert obj.to_dict() == input_data\n```\n\nAs you can see, the code turns out to be massive compared to the\n[alternative](#user-defined-generic-types) but in rare cases such flexibility\ncan be useful. You should think twice about whether it's really worth using it.\n\n### Serialization hooks\n\nIn some cases you need to prepare input / output data or do some extraordinary\nactions at different stages of the deserialization / serialization lifecycle.\nYou can do this with different types of hooks.\n\n#### Before deserialization\n\nFor doing something with a dictionary that will be passed to deserialization\nyou can use `__pre_deserialize__` class method:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    abc: int\n\n    @classmethod\n    def __pre_deserialize__(cls, d: Dict[Any, Any]) -> Dict[Any, Any]:\n        return {k.lower(): v for k, v in d.items()}\n\nprint(DataClass.from_dict({\"ABC\": 123}))    # DataClass(abc=123)\nprint(DataClass.from_json('{\"ABC\": 123}'))  # DataClass(abc=123)\n```\n\n#### After deserialization\n\nFor doing something with a dataclass instance that was created as a result\nof deserialization you can use `__post_deserialize__` class method:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    abc: int\n\n    @classmethod\n    def __post_deserialize__(cls, obj: 'A') -> 'A':\n        obj.abc = 456\n        return obj\n\nprint(DataClass.from_dict({\"abc\": 123}))    # DataClass(abc=456)\nprint(DataClass.from_json('{\"abc\": 123}'))  # DataClass(abc=456)\n```\n\n#### Before serialization\n\nFor doing something before serialization you can use `__pre_serialize__`\nmethod:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    abc: int\n    counter: ClassVar[int] = 0\n\n    def __pre_serialize__(self) -> 'A':\n        self.counter += 1\n        return self\n\nobj = DataClass(abc=123)\nobj.to_dict()\nobj.to_json()\nprint(obj.counter)  # 2\n```\n\nNote that you can add an additional `context` argument using the\n[corresponding](#add-context-keyword-argument) code generation option.\n\n#### After serialization\n\nFor doing something with a dictionary that was created as a result of\nserialization you can use `__post_serialize__` method:\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass A(DataClassJSONMixin):\n    user: str\n    password: str\n\n    def __post_serialize__(self, d: Dict[Any, Any]) -> Dict[Any, Any]:\n        d.pop('password')\n        return d\n\nobj = DataClass(user=\"name\", password=\"secret\")\nprint(obj.to_dict())  # {\"user\": \"name\"}\nprint(obj.to_json())  # '{\"user\": \"name\"}'\n```\n\nNote that you can add an additional `context` argument using the\n[corresponding](#add-context-keyword-argument) code generation option.\n\nJSON Schema\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can build JSON Schema not only for dataclasses but also for any other\n[supported](#supported-data-types) data\ntypes. There is support for the following standards:\n* [Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html)\n* [OpenAPI Specification 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0)\n\n### Building JSON Schema\n\nFor simple one-time cases it's recommended to start from using a configurable\n`build_json_schema` function. It returns `JSONSchema` object that can be\nserialized to json or to dict:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import List\nfrom uuid import UUID\n\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import build_json_schema\n\n\n@dataclass\nclass User:\n    id: UUID\n    name: str = field(metadata={\"description\": \"User name\"})\n\n\nprint(build_json_schema(List[User]).to_json())\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"title\": \"User\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"id\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"format\": \"uuid\"\n            },\n            \"name\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"description\": \"User name\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"additionalProperties\": false,\n        \"required\": [\n            \"id\",\n            \"name\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nAdditional validation keywords ([see below](#json-schema-constraints))\ncan be added using annotations:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Annotated, List\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import build_json_schema\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema.annotations import Maximum, MaxItems\n\nprint(\n    build_json_schema(\n        Annotated[\n            List[Annotated[int, Maximum(42)]],\n            MaxItems(4)\n        ]\n    ).to_json()\n)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\",\n        \"maximum\": 42\n    },\n    \"maxItems\": 4\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nThe [`$schema`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#name-the-schema-keyword)\nkeyword can be added by setting `with_dialect_uri` to True:\n\n```python\nprint(build_json_schema(str, with_dialect_uri=True).to_json())\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nBy default, Draft 2022-12 dialect is being used, but you can change it to\nanother one by setting `dialect` parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import OPEN_API_3_1\n\nprint(\n    build_json_schema(\n        str, dialect=OPEN_API_3_1, with_dialect_uri=True\n    ).to_json()\n)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.1/dialect/base\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nAll dataclass JSON Schemas can or can not be placed in the\n[definitions](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-core.html#name-schema-re-use-with-defs)\nsection, depending on the `all_refs` parameter, which default value comes\nfrom a dialect used (`False` for Draft 2022-12, `True` for OpenAPI\nSpecification 3.1.0):\n\n```python\nprint(build_json_schema(List[User], all_refs=True).to_json())\n```\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"$defs\": {\n        \"User\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"title\": \"User\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"id\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"format\": \"uuid\"\n                },\n                \"name\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"additionalProperties\": false,\n            \"required\": [\n                \"id\",\n                \"name\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/$defs/User\"\n    }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nThe definitions section can be omitted from the final document by setting\n`with_definitions` parameter to `False`:\n\n```python\nprint(\n    build_json_schema(\n        List[User], dialect=OPEN_API_3_1, with_definitions=False\n    ).to_json()\n)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/User\"\n    }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nReference prefix can be changed by using `ref_prefix` parameter:\n\n```python\nprint(\n    build_json_schema(\n        List[User],\n        all_refs=True,\n        with_definitions=False,\n        ref_prefix=\"#/components/responses\",\n    ).to_json()\n)\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/components/responses/User\"\n    }\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nThe omitted definitions could be found later in the `Context` object that\nyou could have created and passed to the function, but it could be easier\nto use `JSONSchemaBuilder` for that. For example, you might found it handy\nto build OpenAPI Specification step by step passing your models to the builder\nand get all the registered definitions later. This builder has reasonable\ndefaults but can be customized if necessary.\n\n```python\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import JSONSchemaBuilder, OPEN_API_3_1\n\nbuilder = JSONSchemaBuilder(OPEN_API_3_1)\n\n@dataclass\nclass User:\n    id: UUID\n    name: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass Device:\n    id: UUID\n    model: str\n\nprint(builder.build(List[User]).to_json())\nprint(builder.build(List[Device]).to_json())\nprint(builder.get_definitions().to_json())\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n        \"$ref\": \"#/components/schemas/User\"\n    }\n}\n```\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"array\",\n    \"items\": {\n

\"additionalProperties\": false,\n        \"required\": [\n            \"id\",\n            \"name\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"Device\": {\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"title\":

}\n}\n```\n</details>\n\n### JSON Schema constraints\n\nApart from required keywords, that are added automatically for certain data\ntypes, you're free to use additional validation keywords.\nThey're presented by the corresponding classes in\n[`mashumaro.jsonschema.annotations`](https://github.com/Fatal1ty/mashumaro/blob/master/mashumaro/jsonschema/annotations.py):\n\nNumber constraints:\n* [`Minimum`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#name-minimum)\n* [`Maximum`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#name-maximum)\n*

[`DependentRequired`](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#name-dependentrequired)\n\n### Extending JSON Schema\n\nUsing a `Config` class it is possible to override some parts of the schema.\nCurrently, you can do the following:\n* override some field schemas using the \"properties\" key\n* change `additionalProperties` using the \"additionalProperties\" key\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import build_json_schema\n\n@dataclass\nclass FooBar:\n    foo: str\n    bar: int\n\n    class Config:\n        json_schema = {\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"foo\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"bar\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"additionalProperties\": True,\n        }\n\nprint(build_json_schema(FooBar).to_json())\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"title\": \"FooBar\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"foo\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"bar\"\n        },\n        \"bar\": {\n            \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"additionalProperties\": true,\n    \"required\": [\n        \"foo\",\n        \"bar\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n</details>\n\nYou can also change the \"additionalProperties\" key to a specific schema\nby passing it a `JSONSchema` instance instead of a bool value.\n\n### JSON Schema and custom serialization methods\n\nMashumaro provides different ways to override default serialization methods for\ndataclass fields or specific data types. In order for these overrides to be\nreflected in the schema, you need to make sure that the methods have\nannotations of the return value type.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom mashumaro.config import BaseConfig\nfrom mashumaro.jsonschema import build_json_schema\n\ndef str_as_list(s: str) -> list[str]:\n    return list(s)\n\ndef int_as_str(i: int) -> str:\n    return str(i)\n\n@dataclass\nclass FooBar:\n    foo: str = field(metadata={\"serialize\": str_as_list})\n    bar: int\n\n    class Config(BaseConfig):\n        serialization_strategy = {\n            int: {\n                \"serialize\": int_as_str\n            }\n        }\n\nprint(build_json_schema(FooBar).to_json())\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the result</summary>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"title\": \"FooBar\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"foo\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"bar\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"additionalProperties\": false,\n    \"required\": [\n        \"foo\",\n        \"bar\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n</details>\n",

It is\noptimized for comparing tables that share a common origin, in other\nwords multiple versions of the \"same\" table.\n\nFor a live demo, see:\n> https://paulfitz.github.io/daff/\n\nInstall the library for your favorite language:\n````sh\nnpm install daff -g  # node/javascript\npip install daff     # python\ngem install daff     # ruby\ncomposer require paulfitz/daff-php  # php\ninstall.packages('daff') # R wrapper by Edwin de Jonge\n````\n\nUse on the web from a CDN:\n```\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daff@latest/lib/daff.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOther translations are available here:\n> https://github.com/paulfitz/daff/releases/tag/v1.3.16\n\nOr use the library to view csv diffs on github via a chrome extension:\n> https://github.com/theodi/csvhub\n\nThe program\n-----------\n\nYou can run `daff`/`daff.py`/`daff.rb` as a utility program:\n````\n$ daff\ndaff can produce and apply tabular diffs.\nCall as:\n  daff a.csv b.csv\n  daff [--color] [--no-color] [--output OUTPUT.csv] a.csv b.csv\n  daff [--output OUTPUT.html] a.csv b.csv\n  daff [--www] a.csv b.csv\n  daff parent.csv a.csv b.csv\n  daff --input-format sqlite a.db b.db\n  daff patch [--inplace] a.csv patch.csv\n  daff merge [--inplace] parent.csv a.csv b.csv\n  daff trim [--output OUTPUT.csv] source.csv\n  daff render [--output OUTPUT.html] diff.csv\n  daff copy in.csv out.tsv\n  daff in.csv\n  daff git\n  daff version\n\nThe --inplace option to patch and merge will result in modification of a.csv.\n\nIf you need more control, here is the full list of flags:\n  daff diff [--output OUTPUT.csv] [--context NUM] [--all] [--act ACT] a.csv b.csv\n     --act ACT:     show only a certain kind of change (update, insert, delete, column)\n     --all:         do not prune unchanged rows or columns\n     --all-rows:    do not prune unchanged rows\n     --all-columns: do not prune unchanged columns\n     --color:       highlight changes with terminal colors (default in terminals)\n     --context NUM: show NUM rows of context (0=none)\n     --context-columns NUM: show NUM columns of context (0=none)\n     --fail-if-diff: return status is 0 if equal, 1 if different, 2 if problem\n     --id:          specify column to use as primary key (repeat for multi-column key)\n     --ignore:      specify column to ignore completely (can repeat)\n     --index:       include row/columns numbers from original tables\n     --input-format [csv|tsv|ssv|psv|json|sqlite]: set format to expect for input\n     --eol [crlf|lf|cr|auto]: separator between rows of csv output.\n     --no-color:    make sure terminal colors are not used\n     --ordered:     assume row order is meaningful (default for CSV)\n     --output-format [csv|tsv|ssv|psv|json|copy|html]: set format for output\n     --padding [dense|sparse|smart]: set padding method for aligning columns\n     --table NAME:  compare the named table, used with SQL sources.

Run `daff git` for instructions\non doing this manually. Your CSV diffs and merges will get smarter,\nsince git will suddenly understand about rows and columns, not just lines:\n\n![Example CSV diff](http://paulfitz.github.io/daff-doc/images/daff_vs_diff.png)\n\nThe library\n-----------\n\nYou can use `daff` as a library from any supported language.  We take\nhere the example of Javascript.  To use `daff` on a webpage,\nfirst include `daff.js`:\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daff@1.4.2/lib/daff.min.js\"></script>\n```\nYou can find a [minimal demo](https://paulfitz.github.io/daff/minimal-demo.html) on the project website.\nOr if using node outside the browser:\n```js\nvar daff = require('daff');\n```\n\nFor concreteness, assume we have two versions of a table,\n`data1` and `data2`:\n```js\nconst data1 = [\n    ['Country','Capital'],\n    ['Ireland','Dublin'],\n    ['France','Paris'],\n    ['Spain','Barcelona']\n];\nconst data2 = [\n    ['Country','Code','Capital'],\n    ['Ireland','ie','Dublin'],\n    ['France','fr','Paris'],\n    ['Spain','es','Madrid'],\n    ['Germany','de','Berlin']\n];\n```\n\nTo make those tables accessible to the library, we wrap them\nin `daff.TableView`:\n```js\nconst table1 = new daff.TableView(data1);\nconst table2 = new daff.TableView(data2);\n```\n\nWe can now compute the alignment between the rows and columns\nin the two tables:\n```js\nconst alignment = daff.compareTables(table1,table2).align();\n```\n\nTo produce a diff from the alignment, we first need a table\nfor the output:\n```js\nconst data_diff = [];\nconst table_diff = new daff.TableView(data_diff);\n```\n\nUsing default options for the diff:\n```js\nconst flags = new daff.CompareFlags();\nconst highlighter = new daff.TableDiff(alignment,flags);\nhighlighter.hilite(table_diff);\n```\n\nThe diff is now in `data_diff` in highlighter format, see\nspecification here:\n> http://paulfitz.github.io/daff-doc/spec.html\n>\n> https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-diff/\n\n```js\n[ [ '!', '', '+++', '' ],\n  [ '@@', 'Country', 'Code', 'Capital' ],\n  [ '+', 'Ireland', 'ie', 'Dublin' ],\n  [ '+', 'France', 'fr', 'Paris' ],\n  [ '->', 'Spain', 'es', 'Barcelona->Madrid' ],\n  [ '+++', 'Germany', 'de', 'Berlin' ] ]\n```\n\nFor visualization, you may want to convert this to a HTML table\nwith appropriate classes on cells so you can color-code inserts,\ndeletes, updates, etc.  You can do this with:\n```js\nconst diff2html = new daff.DiffRender();\ndiff2html.render(table_diff);\nconst table_diff_html = diff2html.html();\n```\n\nFor 3-way differences (that is, comparing two tables given knowledge\nof a common ancestor) use `daff.compareTables3` (give ancestor\ntable as the first argument).\n\nHere is how to apply that difference as a patch:\n```js\nconst patcher = new daff.HighlightPatch(table1,table_diff);\npatcher.apply();\n// table1 should now equal table2\n```\n\nFor other languages, you should find sample code in\nthe packages on the [Releases](https://github.com/paulfitz/daff/releases/tag/v1.3.16) page.\n\nSupported languages\n-------------------\n\nThe `daff` library is written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), which\ncan be translated reasonably well into at least the following languages:\n\n * Javascript\n * Python\n * Java\n * C#\n * C++\n * Ruby (using an [unofficial haxe target](https://github.com/paulfitz/haxe) developed for `daff`)\n * PHP\n\nSome translations are done for you on the\n[Releases](https://github.com/paulfitz/daff/releases) page.\nTo make another translation, or to compile from source\nfirst follow the [Haxe language introduction](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/language-introduction.html) for the\nlanguage you care about.  At the time of writing, if you are on OSX, you should\ninstall haxe using `brew install haxe`.  Then do one of:\n\n```\nmake js\nmake php\nmake py\nmake java\nmake cs\nmake cpp\n```\n\nFor each language, the `daff` library expects to be handed an interface to tables you create, rather than creating them\nitself.  This is to avoid inefficient copies from one format to another.  You'll find a `SimpleTable` class you can use if\nyou find this awkward.\n\nOther possibilities:\n\n * There's a daff wrapper for R written by [Edwin de Jonge](https://github.com/edwindj), see https://github.com/edwindj/daff and http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/daff\n * There's a hand-written ruby port by [James Smith](https://github.com/Floppy), see https://github.com/theodi/coopy-ruby\n\nAPI documentation\n-----------------\n\n * You can browse the `daff` classes at http://paulfitz.github.io/daff-doc/\n\nSponsors\n--------\n\nThe <a href=\"https://datacommons.coop\">Data Commons Co-op</a>,  \"perhaps the geekiest of all cooperative organizations on the planet,\" has given great moral support during the development of `daff`.\nDonate a multiple of `42.42` in your currency to let them know you care: <a href=\"https://datacommons.coop/donate/\">https://datacommons.coop/donate/</a>.\n\nReading material\n----------------\n\n * https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-diff : a specification of the diff format we use.\n * http://theodi.org/blog/csvhub-github-diffs-for-csv-files : using this library with github.\n * https://github.com/ropensci/unconf/issues/19 : a thread about diffing data in which daff shows up in at least four guises (see if you can spot them all).\n * http://theodi.org/blog/adapting-git-simple-data : using this library with gitlab.\n * http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/08/08/diffing-and-patching-data.html : a summary of where the library came from.\n * http://blog.okfn.org/2013/07/02/git-and-github-for-data/ : a post about storing small data in git/github.\n * http://blog.ouseful.info/2013/08/27/diff-or-chop-github-csv-data-files-and-openrefine/ : counterpoint - a post discussing tracked-changes rather than diffs.\n * http://blog.byronjsmith.com/makefile-shortcuts.html : a tutorial on using `make` for data, with daff in the mix. \"Since git considers changes on a per-line basis,\n   looking at diffs of comma-delimited and tab-delimited files can get obnoxious.

        "description": "# MessagePack for Python\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python/actions/workflows/wheel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python/actions/workflows/wheel.yml)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/msgpack-python/badge/?version=latest)](https://msgpack-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n\n## What is this?\n\n[MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) is an efficient binary serialization format.\nIt lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON.\nBut it's faster and smaller.\nThis package provides CPython bindings for reading and writing MessagePack data.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ pip install msgpack\n```\n\n### Pure Python implementation\n\nThe extension module in msgpack (`msgpack._cmsgpack`) does not support PyPy.\n\nBut msgpack provides a pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`) for PyPy.\n\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you can't use a binary distribution, you need to install Visual Studio\nor the Windows SDK on Windows.\nWithout the extension, the pure Python implementation on CPython runs slowly.\n\n\n## How to use\n\n### One-shot pack & unpack\n\nUse `packb` for packing and `unpackb` for unpacking.\nmsgpack provides `dumps` and `loads` as aliases for compatibility with\n`json` and `pickle`.\n\n`pack` and `dump` pack to a file-like object.\n`unpack` and `load` unpack from a file-like object.\n\n```pycon\n>>> import msgpack\n>>> msgpack.packb([1, 2, 3])\n'\\x93\\x01\\x02\\x03'\n>>> msgpack.unpackb(_)\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nRead the docstring for options.\n\n\n### Streaming unpacking\n\n`Unpacker` is a \"streaming unpacker\". It unpacks multiple objects from one\nstream (or from bytes provided through its `feed` method).\n\n```py\nimport msgpack\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\nbuf = BytesIO()\nfor i in range(100):\n   buf.write(msgpack.packb(i))\n\nbuf.seek(0)\n\nunpacker = msgpack.Unpacker(buf)\nfor unpacked in unpacker:\n    print(unpacked)\n```\n\n\n### Packing/unpacking of custom data types\n\nIt is also possible to pack/unpack custom data types. Here is an example for\n`datetime.datetime`.\n\n```py\nimport datetime\nimport msgpack\n\nuseful_dict = {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"created\": datetime.datetime.now(),\n}\n\ndef decode_datetime(obj):\n    if '__datetime__' in obj:\n        obj = datetime.datetime.strptime(obj[\"as_str\"], \"%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n    return obj\n\ndef encode_datetime(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, datetime.datetime):\n        return {'__datetime__': True, 'as_str': obj.strftime(\"%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%S.%f\")}\n    return obj\n\n\npacked_dict = msgpack.packb(useful_dict, default=encode_datetime)\nthis_dict_again = msgpack.unpackb(packed_dict, object_hook=decode_datetime)\n```\n\n`Unpacker`'s `object_hook` callback receives a dict; the\n`object_pairs_hook` callback may instead be used to receive a list of\nkey-value pairs.\n\nNOTE: msgpack can encode datetime with tzinfo into standard ext type for now.\nSee `datetime` option in `Packer` docstring.\n\n\n### Extended types\n\nIt is also possible to pack/unpack custom data types using the **ext** type.\n\n```pycon\n>>> import msgpack\n>>> import array\n>>> def default(obj):\n...     if isinstance(obj, array.array) and obj.typecode == 'd':\n...         return msgpack.ExtType(42, obj.tostring())\n...     raise TypeError(\"Unknown type: %r\" % (obj,))\n...\n>>> def ext_hook(code, data):\n...     if code == 42:\n...         a = array.array('d')\n...         a.fromstring(data)\n...         return a\n...     return ExtType(code, data)\n...\n>>> data = array.array('d', [1.2, 3.4])\n>>> packed = msgpack.packb(data, default=default)\n>>> unpacked = msgpack.unpackb(packed, ext_hook=ext_hook)\n>>> data == unpacked\nTrue\n```\n\n\n### Advanced unpacking control\n\nAs an alternative to iteration, `Unpacker` objects provide `unpack`,\n`skip`, `read_array_header`, and `read_map_header` methods. The former two\nread an entire message from the stream, respectively deserializing and returning\nthe result, or ignoring it. The latter two methods return the number of elements\nin the upcoming container, so that each element in an array, or key-value pair\nin a map, can be unpacked or skipped individually.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n### String and binary types in the old MessagePack spec\n\nEarly versions of msgpack didn't distinguish string and binary types.\nThe type for representing both string and binary types was named **raw**.\n\nYou can pack into and unpack from this old spec using `use_bin_type=False`\nand `raw=True` options.\n\n```pycon\n>>> import msgpack\n>>> msgpack.unpackb(msgpack.packb([b'spam', 'eggs'], use_bin_type=False), raw=True)\n[b'spam', b'eggs']\n>>> msgpack.unpackb(msgpack.packb([b'spam', 'eggs'], use_bin_type=True), raw=False)\n[b'spam', 'eggs']\n```\n\n### ext type\n\nTo use the **ext** type, pass a `msgpack.ExtType` object to the packer.\n\n```pycon\n>>> import msgpack\n>>> packed = msgpack.packb(msgpack.ExtType(42, b'xyzzy'))\n>>> msgpack.unpackb(packed)\nExtType(code=42, data='xyzzy')\n```\n\nYou can use it with `default` and `ext_hook`. See below.\n\n\n### Security\n\nWhen unpacking data received from an unreliable source, msgpack provides\ntwo security options.\n\n`max_buffer_size` (default: `100*1024*1024`) limits the internal buffer size.\nIt is also used to limit preallocated list sizes.\n\n`strict_map_key` (default: `True`) limits the type of map keys to bytes and str.\nWhile the MessagePack spec doesn't limit map key types,\nthere is a risk of a hash DoS.\nIf you need to support other types for map keys, use `strict_map_key=False`.\n\n\n### Performance tips\n\nCPython's GC starts when the number of allocated objects grows.\nThis means unpacking may trigger unnecessary GC.\nYou can use `gc.disable()` when unpacking a large message.\n\nA list is the default sequence type in Python.\nHowever, a tuple is lighter than a list.\nYou can use `use_list=False` while unpacking when performance is important.\n\n\n## Major breaking changes in the history\n\n### msgpack 0.5\n\nThe package name on PyPI was changed from `msgpack-python` to `msgpack` in 0.5.\n\nWhen upgrading from msgpack-0.4 or earlier, do `pip uninstall msgpack-python` before\n`pip install -U msgpack`.\n\n\n### msgpack 1.0\n\n* Python 2 support\n\n  * The extension module no longer supports Python 2.\n    The pure Python implementation (`msgpack.fallback`) is used for Python 2.\n  \n  * msgpack 1.0.6 drops official support of Python 2.7, as pip and\n    GitHub Action \"setup-python\" no longer supports Python 2.7.\n\n* Packer\n\n  * Packer uses `use_bin_type=True` by default.\n    Bytes are encoded in the bin type in MessagePack.\n  * The `encoding` option is removed. UTF-8 is always used.\n\n* Unpacker\n\n  * Unpacker uses `raw=False` by default. It assumes str values are valid UTF-8 strings\n    and decodes them to Python str (Unicode) objects.\n  * `encoding` option is removed.  You can use `raw=True` to support old format (e.g. unpack into bytes, not str).\n  * The default value of `max_buffer_size` is changed from 0 to 100 MiB to avoid DoS attacks.\n    You need to pass `max_buffer_size=0` if you have large but safe data.\n  * The default value of `strict_map_key` is changed to True to avoid hash DoS.\n    You need to pass `strict_map_key=False` if you have data that contain map keys\n    whose type is neither bytes nor str.\n",

Characters that have special meanings are\nreplaced so that they display as the actual characters. This mitigates\ninjection attacks, meaning untrusted user input can safely be displayed\non a page.\n\n\n## Examples\n\n```pycon\n>>> from markupsafe import Markup, escape\n\n>>> # escape replaces special characters and wraps in Markup\n>>> escape(\"<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>\")\nMarkup('&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;')\n\n>>> # wrap in Markup to mark text \"safe\" and prevent escaping\n>>> Markup(\"<strong>Hello</strong>\")\nMarkup('<strong>hello</strong>')\n\n>>> escape(Markup(\"<strong>Hello</strong>\"))\nMarkup('<strong>hello</strong>')\n\n>>> # Markup is a str subclass\n>>> # methods and operators escape their arguments\n>>> template = Markup(\"Hello <em>{name}</em>\")\n>>> template.format(name='\"World\"')\nMarkup('Hello <em>&#34;World&#34;</em>')\n```\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports MarkupSafe and other\npopular packages. In order to grow the community of contributors and\nusers, and allow the maintainers to devote more time to the projects,\n[please donate today][].\n\n[please donate today]: https://palletsprojects.com/donate\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee our [detailed contributing documentation][contrib] for many ways to\ncontribute, including reporting issues, requesting features, asking or answering\nquestions, and making PRs.\n\n[contrib]: https://palletsprojects.com/contributing/\n",

started\n===============\n\nTo get started, install the library with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    pip install more-itertools\n\nThe recipes from the `itertools docs <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes>`_\nare included in the top-level package:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from more_itertools import flatten\n    >>> iterable = [(0, 1), (2, 3)]\n    >>> list(flatten(iterable))\n    [0, 1, 2, 3]\n\nSeveral new recipes are available as well:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> from more_itertools import chunked\n    >>> iterable = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n    >>> list(chunked(iterable, 3))\n    [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]\n\n    >>> from more_itertools import spy\n    >>> iterable = (x * x for x in range(1, 6))\n    >>> head, iterable = spy(iterable, n=3)\n    >>> list(head)\n    [1, 4, 9]\n    >>> list(iterable)\n    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n\n\nFor the full listing of functions, see the

        "summary": "Utility library for gitignore style pattern matching of file paths.",
        "description": "\nPathSpec\n========\n\n*pathspec* is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths. So\nfar this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching which itself is\nderived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses wildmatch for its `gitignore`_\nfiles.\n\n.. _`gitignore`: http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\n\n\nTutorial\n--------\n\nSay you have a \"Projects\" directory and you want to back it up, but only\ncertain files, and ignore others depending on certain conditions::\n\n\t>>> import pathspec\n\t>>> # The gitignore-style patterns for files to select, but we're including\n\t>>> # instead of ignoring.\n\t>>> spec_text = \"\"\"\n\t...\n\t... # This is a comment because the line begins with a hash: \"#\"\n\t...\n\t... # Include several project directories (and all descendants) relative to\n\t... # the current directory. To reference a directory you must end with a\n\t... # slash: \"/\"\n\t... /project-a/\n\t... /project-b/\n\t... /project-c/\n\t...\n\t... # Patterns can be negated by prefixing with exclamation mark: \"!\"\n\t...\n\t... # Ignore temporary files beginning or ending with \"~\" and ending with\n\t... # \".swp\".\n\t... !~*\n\t... !*~\n\t... !*.swp\n\t...\n\t... # These are python projects so ignore compiled python files from\n\t... # testing.\n\t... !*.pyc\n\t...\n\t... # Ignore the build directories but only directly under the project\n\t... # directories.\n\t... !/*/build/\n\t...\n\t... \"\"\"\n\nWe want to use the ``GitWildMatchPattern`` class to compile our patterns. The\n``PathSpec`` class provides an interface around pattern implementations::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())\n\nThat may be a mouthful but it allows for additional patterns to be implemented\nin the future without them having to deal with anything but matching the paths\nsent to them. ``GitWildMatchPattern`` is the implementation of the actual\npattern which internally gets converted into a regular expression. ``PathSpec``\nis a simple wrapper around a list of compiled patterns.\n\nTo make things simpler, we can use the registered name for a pattern class\ninstead of always having to provide a reference to the class itself. The\n``GitWildMatchPattern`` class is registered as **gitwildmatch**::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', spec_text.splitlines())\n\nIf we wanted to manually compile the patterns we can just do the following::\n\n\t>>> patterns = map(pathspec.patterns.GitWildMatchPattern, spec_text.splitlines())\n\t>>> spec = PathSpec(patterns)\n\n``PathSpec.from_lines()`` is simply a class method which does just that.\n\nIf you want to load the patterns from file, you can pass the file instance\ndirectly as well::\n\n\t>>> with open('patterns.list', 'r') as fh:\n\t>>>     spec = pathspec.PathSpec.from_lines('gitwildmatch', fh)\n\nYou can perform matching on a whole directory tree with::\n\n\t>>> matches = spec.match_tree('path/to/directory')\n\nOr you can perform matching on a specific set of file paths with::\n\n\t>>> matches = spec.match_files(file_paths)\n\nOr check to see if an individual file matches::\n\n\t>>> is_matched = spec.match_file(file_path)\n\nThere is a specialized class, ``pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec``, which more closely\nimplements the behavior of **gitignore**. This uses ``GitWildMatchPattern``\npattern by default and handles some edge cases differently from the generic\n``PathSpec`` class. ``GitIgnoreSpec`` can be used without specifying the pattern\nfactory::\n\n\t>>> spec = pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec.from_lines(spec_text.splitlines())\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n*pathspec* is licensed under the `Mozilla Public License Version 2.0`_.

See `Pull #82`_.\n\n\nAPI changes:\n\n- Signature of protected method `pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec._match_file()` (with a leading underscore) has been changed from `def _match_file(patterns: Iterable[Pattern], file: str) -> bool` to `def _match_file(patterns: Iterable[Tuple[int, Pattern]], file: str) -> Tuple[Optional[bool], Optional[int]]`.\n\nNew features:\n\n- Added `pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec.check_*()` methods. These methods behave similarly to `.match_*()` but return additional information in the `pathspec.util.CheckResult` objects (e.g., `CheckResult.index` indicates the index of the last pattern that matched the file).\n- Added `pathspec.pattern.RegexPattern.pattern` attribute which stores the original, uncompiled pattern.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #81`_: GitIgnoreSpec behaviors differ from git.\n- `Pull #83`_: Fix ReadTheDocs builds.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Mark Python 3.12 as supported.

See `Issue #47`_.\n- The *gitwildmatch* pattern `dir/*` is now handled the same as `dir/`. This means `dir/*` will now match all descendants rather than only direct children. See `Issue #19`_.\n- Added `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec` class (see new features).\n- Changed build system to `pyproject.toml`_ and build backend to `setuptools.build_meta`_ which may have unforeseen consequences.\n- Renamed GitHub project from `python-path-specification`_ to `python-pathspec`_. See `Issue #35`_.\n\nAPI changes:\n\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.match_files()` is an old function no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.normalize_files()` is no longer used.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.util.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.\n- Deprecated: `pathspec.iter_tree()` is an alias for `pathspec.util.iter_tree_files()`.\n-\tDeprecated: `pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match()` is no longer used. Use or implement\n\t`pathspec.pattern.Pattern.match_file()`.\n\nNew features:\n\n- Added class `pathspec.gitignore.GitIgnoreSpec` (with alias `pathspec.GitIgnoreSpec`) to implement *gitignore* behavior not possible with standard `PathSpec` class. The particular *gitignore* behavior implemented is prioritizing patterns matching the file directly over matching an ancestor directory.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- `Issue #19`_: Files inside an ignored sub-directory are not matched.\n- `Issue #41`_: Incorrectly (?) matches files inside directories that do match.\n- `Pull #51`_: Refactor deprecated unittest aliases for Python 3.11 compatibility.\n- `Issue #53`_: Symlink pathspec_meta.py breaks Windows.\n- `Issue #54`_: test_util.py uses os.symlink which can fail on Windows.\n- `Issue #55`_: Backslashes at start of pattern not handled correctly.\n- `Pull #56`_: pyproject.toml: include subpackages in setuptools config\n- `Issue #57`_: `!` doesn't exclude files in directories if the pattern doesn't have a trailing slash.\n\nImprovements:\n\n- Support Python 3.10, 3.11.\n- Modernize code to Python 3.7.\n- `Issue #52`_: match_files() is not a pure generator function, and it impacts tree_*() gravely.\n\n\n.. _`python-path-specification`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-path-specification\n.. _`python-pathspec`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec\n.. _`pyproject.toml`: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/\n.. _`setuptools.build_meta`: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html\n.. _`Issue #19`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/19\n.. _`Issue #35`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/35\n.. _`Issue #41`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/41\n.. _`Issue #47`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/47\n.. _`Pull #51`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/51\n.. _`Issue #52`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/52\n.. _`Issue #53`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/53\n.. _`Issue #54`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/54\n.. _`Issue #55`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/55\n.. _`Pull #56`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/56\n.. _`Issue #57`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/57\n\n\n0.9.0 (2021-07-17)\n------------------\n\n- `Issue #44`_/`Pull #50`_: Raise `GitWildMatchPatternError` for invalid git patterns.\n- `Pull #45`_: Fix for duplicate leading double-asterisk, and edge cases.\n- `Issue #46`_: Fix matching absolute paths.\n- API change: `util.normalize_files()` now returns a `Dict[str, List[pathlike]]` instead of a `Dict[str, pathlike]`.\n- Added type hinting.\n\n.. _`Issue #44`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/44\n.. _`Pull #45`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/45\n.. _`Issue #46`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/issues/46\n.. _`Pull #50`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/50\n\n\n0.8.1 (2020-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- `Pull #43`_: Add support for addition operator.\n\n.. _`Pull #43`: https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec/pull/43\n\n\n0.8.0 (2020-04-09)\n------------------\n\n- `Issue #30`_: Expose what patterns matched paths.

        "description": "\n# dbt extractor\n## Understanding dbt-extractor\n\nThis repository contains a tool that processes the most common jinja value templates in dbt model files. The tool depends on tree-sitter and the tree-sitter-jinja2 library.\n\n![demo app](demo/demo.gif)\n\n## Getting started\n\n- Read the [introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction/) and [viewpoint](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/about/viewpoint/) of dbt\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe current strategy is for this processor to be 100% certain when it can accurately extract values from a given model file. Anything less than 100% certainty returns an exception so that the model can be rendered with python Jinja instead. \n\nThere are two cases we want to avoid because they would risk correctness to user's projects:\n1. Confidently extracting values that would not be extracted by python jinja (false positives)\n2. Confidently extracting a set of values that are missing values that python jinja would have extracted. (misses)\n\nIf we instead error when we could have confidently extracted values, there is no correctness risk to the user. Only an opportunity to expand the rules to encompass this class of cases as well.\n\nEven though jinja in dbt is not a typed language, the type checker statically determines whether or not the current implementation can confidently extract values without relying on python jinja rendering, which is when these errors would otherwise surface. This type checker will become more permissive over time as this tool expands to include more dbt and jinja features.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThis architecture is optimized for value extraction and for future flexibility. This architecture is expected to change, and is coded in fp-style stages to make those changes easier for the future.\n\nThis processor is composed of several stages:\n1. parser\n2. type checker\n3. extractor\n\nAdditionally, the following tools utilize the above processor:\n1. browser-based demo of dbt extraction as you type\n\nThe tree-sitter parser is located in the tree-sitter-jinja2 library. The rust bindings are used to traverse the concrete syntax tree that tree-sitter creates in order to create a typed abstract syntax tree in the type checking stage. The errors in the type checking stage are not raised to the user, and are instead used by developers to debug tests.\n\nThe parser is solely responsible for turning text into recognized values, while the type checker does arity checking, and enforces argument list types (e.g. nested function calls like `{{ config(my_ref=ref('table')) }}` will parse but not type check even though it is valid dbt syntax. The tool at this time doesn't have an agreed serialization to communicate refs as config values, but could in the future.)\n\nThe extractor uses the typed abstract syntax tree to easily identify all the refs, sources, and configs present and extract them.\n\n## Join the dbt Community\n\n- Be part of the conversation in the [dbt Community Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/)\n- Read more on the [dbt Community Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com)\n\n## Reporting bugs and contributing code\n\n- Want to report a bug or request a feature? Let us know on [Slack](http://community.getdbt.com/), or open [an issue](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-extractor/issues/new)\n- Want to help us build `dbt-extractor`? Check out the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-extractor/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone interacting in the dbt project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms, and mailing lists is expected to follow the [dbt Code of Conduct](https://community.getdbt.com/code-of-conduct).\n\n",

Its main features are the complete implementation of\nthe Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety (several threads can\nshare the same connection).  It was designed for heavily multi-threaded\napplications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a large number\nof concurrent \"INSERT\"s or \"UPDATE\"s.\n\nPsycopg 2 is mostly implemented in C as a libpq wrapper, resulting in being\nboth efficient and secure.  It features client-side and server-side cursors,\nasynchronous communication and notifications, \"COPY TO/COPY FROM\" support.\nMany Python types are supported out-of-the-box and adapted to matching\nPostgreSQL data types; adaptation can be extended and customized thanks to a\nflexible objects adaptation system.\n\nPsycopg 2 is both Unicode and Python 3 friendly.\n\n.. Note::\n\n    The psycopg2 package is still widely used and actively maintained, but it\n    is not expected to receive new features.\n\n    `Psycopg 3`__ is the evolution of psycopg2 and is where `new features are\n    being developed`__: if you are starting a new project you should probably\n    start from 3!\n\n    .. __: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg/\n    .. __: https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/index.html\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nDocumentation is included in the ``doc`` directory and is `available online`__.\n\n.. __: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/\n\nFor any other resource (source code repository, bug tracker, mailing list)\nplease check the `project homepage`__.\n\n.. __: https://psycopg.org/\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nBuilding Psycopg requires a few prerequisites (a C compiler, some development\npackages): please check the install_ and the faq_ documents in the ``doc`` dir\nor online for the details.\n\nIf prerequisites are met, you can install psycopg like any other Python\npackage, using ``pip`` to download it from PyPI_::\n\n    $ pip install psycopg2\n\nor using ``setup.py`` if you have downloaded the source package locally::\n\n    $ python setup.py build\n    $ sudo python setup.py install\n\nYou can also obtain a stand-alone package, not requiring a compiler or\nexternal libraries, by installing the `psycopg2-binary`_ package from PyPI::\n\n    $ pip install psycopg2-binary\n\nThe binary package is a practical choice for development and testing but in\nproduction it is advised to use the package built from sources.\n\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/\n.. _psycopg2-binary: https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/\n.. _install: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#install-from-source\n.. _faq: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/faq.html#faq-compile\n\n:Build status: |gh-actions|\n\n.. |gh-actions| image:: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/actions/workflows/tests.yml\n    :alt: Build status\n",

In some cases,\nwe also note alternative representations which do not require this package.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\npip install annotated-types\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Annotated\nfrom annotated_types import Gt, Len, Predicate\n\nclass MyClass:\n    age: Annotated[int, Gt(18)]                         # Valid: 19, 20, ...\n                                                        # Invalid: 17, 18, \"19\", 19.0, ...\n    factors: list[Annotated[int, Predicate(is_prime)]]  # Valid: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...\n                                                        # Invalid: 4, 8, -2, 5.0, \"prime\", ...\n\n    my_list: Annotated[list[int], Len(0, 10)]           # Valid: [], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n                                                        # Invalid: (1, 2), [\"abc\"], [0] * 20\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n_While `annotated-types` avoids runtime checks for performance, users should not\nconstruct invalid combinations such as `MultipleOf(\"non-numeric\")` or `Annotated[int, Len(3)]`.\nDownstream implementors may choose to raise an error, emit a warning, silently ignore\na metadata item, etc., if the metadata objects described below are used with an\nincompatible type - or for any other reason!_\n\n### Gt, Ge, Lt, Le\n\nExpress inclusive and/or exclusive bounds on orderable values - which may be numbers,\ndates, times, strings, sets, etc. Note that the boundary value need not be of the\nsame type that was annotated, so long as they can be compared: `Annotated[int, Gt(1.5)]`\nis fine, for example, and implies that the value is an integer x such that `x > 1.5`.\n\nWe suggest that implementors may also interpret `functools.partial(operator.le, 1.5)`\nas being equivalent to `Gt(1.5)`, for users who wish to avoid a runtime dependency on\nthe `annotated-types` package.\n\nTo be explicit, these types have the following meanings:\n\n* `Gt(x)` - value must be \"Greater Than\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive minimum\n* `Ge(x)` - value must be \"Greater than or Equal\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive minimum\n* `Lt(x)` - value must be \"Less Than\" `x` - equivalent to exclusive maximum\n* `Le(x)` - value must be \"Less than or Equal\" to `x` - equivalent to inclusive maximum\n\n### Interval\n\n`Interval(gt, ge, lt, le)` allows you to specify an upper and lower bound with a single\nmetadata object. `None` attributes should be ignored, and non-`None` attributes\ntreated as per the single bounds above.\n\n### MultipleOf\n\n`MultipleOf(multiple_of=x)` might be interpreted in two ways:\n\n1. Python semantics, implying `value % multiple_of == 0`, or\n2. [JSONschema semantics](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.6.2.1),\n   where `int(value / multiple_of) == value / multiple_of`.\n\nWe encourage users to be aware of these two common interpretations and their\ndistinct behaviours, especially since very large or non-integer numbers make\nit easy to cause silent data corruption due to floating-point imprecision.\n\nWe encourage libraries to carefully document which interpretation they implement.\n\n### MinLen, MaxLen, Len\n\n`Len()` implies that `min_length <= len(value) <= max_length` - lower and upper bounds are inclusive.\n\nAs well as `Len()` which can optionally include upper and lower bounds, we also\nprovide `MinLen(x)` and `MaxLen(y)` which are equivalent to `Len(min_length=x)`\nand `Len(max_length=y)` respectively.\n\n`Len`, `MinLen`, and `MaxLen` may be used with any type which supports `len(value)`.\n\nExamples of usage:\n\n* `Annotated[list, MaxLen(10)]` (or `Annotated[list, Len(max_length=10))`) - list must have a length of 10 or less\n* `Annotated[str, MaxLen(10)]` - string must have a length of 10 or less\n* `Annotated[list, MinLen(3))` (or `Annotated[list, Len(min_length=3))`) - list must have a length of 3 or more\n* `Annotated[list, Len(4, 6)]` - list must have a length of 4, 5, or 6\n* `Annotated[list, Len(8, 8)]` - list must have a length of exactly 8\n\n#### Changed in v0.4.0\n\n* `min_inclusive` has been renamed to `min_length`, no change in meaning\n* `max_exclusive` has been renamed to `max_length`, upper bound is now **inclusive** instead of **exclusive**\n* The recommendation that slices are interpreted as `Len` has been removed due to ambiguity and different semantic\n  meaning of the upper bound in slices vs. `Len`\n\nSee [issue #23](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/issues/23) for discussion.\n\n### Timezone\n\n`Timezone` can be used with a `datetime` or a `time` to express which timezones\nare allowed. `Annotated[datetime, Timezone(None)]` must be a naive datetime.\n`Timezone[...]` ([literal ellipsis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis))\nexpresses that any timezone-aware datetime is allowed. You may also pass a specific\ntimezone string or [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects)\nobject such as `Timezone(timezone.utc)` or `Timezone(\"Africa/Abidjan\")` to express that you only\nallow a specific timezone, though we note that this is often a symptom of fragile design.\n\n#### Changed in v0.x.x\n\n* `Timezone` accepts [`tzinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#tzinfo-objects) objects instead of\n  `timezone`, extending compatibility to [`zoneinfo`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) and third party libraries.\n\n### Unit\n\n`Unit(unit: str)` expresses that the annotated numeric value is the magnitude of\na quantity with the specified unit. For example, `Annotated[float, Unit(\"m/s\")]`\nwould be a float representing a velocity in meters per second.\n\nPlease note that `annotated_types` itself makes no attempt to parse or validate\nthe unit string in any way. That is left entirely to downstream libraries,\nsuch as [`pint`](https://pint.readthedocs.io) or\n[`astropy.units`](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/).\n\nAn example of how a library might use this metadata:\n\n```python\nfrom annotated_types import Unit\nfrom typing import Annotated, TypeVar, Callable, Any, get_origin, get_args\n\n# given a type annotated with a unit:\nMeters = Annotated[float, Unit(\"m\")]\n\n\n# you can cast the annotation to a specific unit type with any\n# callable that accepts a string and returns the desired type\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\ndef cast_unit(tp: Any, unit_cls: Callable[[str], T]) -> T | None:\n    if get_origin(tp) is Annotated:\n        for arg in get_args(tp):\n            if isinstance(arg, Unit):\n                return unit_cls(arg.unit)\n    return None\n\n\n# using `pint`\nimport pint\npint_unit = cast_unit(Meters, pint.Unit)\n\n\n# using `astropy.units`\nimport astropy.units as u\nastropy_unit = cast_unit(Meters, u.Unit)\n```\n\n### Predicate\n\n`Predicate(func: Callable)` expresses that `func(value)` is truthy for valid values.\nUsers should prefer the statically inspectable metadata above, but if you need\nthe full power and flexibility of arbitrary runtime predicates... here it is.\n\nFor some common constraints, we provide generic types:\n\n* `IsLower       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.islower)]`\n* `IsUpper       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isupper)]`\n* `IsDigit       = Annotated[T, Predicate(str.isdigit)]`\n* `IsFinite      = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isfinite)]`\n* `IsNotFinite   = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isfinite))]`\n* `IsNan         = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isnan)]`\n* `IsNotNan      = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isnan))]`\n* `IsInfinite    = Annotated[T, Predicate(math.isinf)]`\n* `IsNotInfinite = Annotated[T, Predicate(Not(math.isinf))]`\n\nso that you can write e.g. `x: IsFinite[float] = 2.0` instead of the longer\n(but exactly equivalent) `x: Annotated[float, Predicate(math.isfinite)] = 2.0`.\n\nSome libraries might have special logic to handle known or understandable predicates,\nfor example by checking for `str.isdigit` and using its presence to both call custom\nlogic to enforce digit-only strings, and customise some generated external schema.\nUsers are therefore encouraged to avoid indirection like `lambda s: s.lower()`, in\nfavor of introspectable methods such as `str.lower` or `re.compile(\"pattern\").search`.\n\nTo enable basic negation of commonly used predicates like `math.isnan` without introducing introspection that makes it impossible for implementers to introspect the predicate we provide a `Not` wrapper that simply negates the predicate in an introspectable manner. Several of the predicates listed above are created in this manner.\n\nWe do not specify what behaviour should be expected for predicates that raise\nan exception.  For example `Annotated[int, Predicate(str.isdigit)]` might silently\nskip invalid constraints, or statically raise an error; or it might try calling it\nand then propagate or discard the resulting\n`TypeError: descriptor 'isdigit' for 'str' objects doesn't apply to a 'int' object`\nexception.  We encourage libraries to document the behaviour they choose.\n\n### Doc\n\n`doc()` can be used to add documentation information in `Annotated`, for function and method parameters, variables, class attributes, return types, and any place where `Annotated` can be used.\n\nIt expects a value that can be statically analyzed, as the main use case is for static analysis, editors, documentation generators, and similar tools.\n\nIt returns a `DocInfo` class with a single attribute `documentation` containing the value passed to `doc()`.\n\nThis is the early adopter's alternative form of the [`typing-doc` proposal](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/typing-doc/typing_doc.md).\n\n### Integrating downstream types with `GroupedMetadata`\n\nImplementers may choose to provide a convenience wrapper that groups multiple pieces of metadata.\nThis can help reduce verbosity and cognitive overhead for users.\nFor example, an implementer like Pydantic might provide a `Field` or `Meta` type that accepts keyword arguments and transforms these into low-level metadata:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Iterator\nfrom annotated_types import GroupedMetadata, Ge\n\n@dataclass\nclass Field(GroupedMetadata):\n    ge: int | None = None\n    description: str | None = None\n\n    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[object]:\n        # Iterating over a GroupedMetadata object should yield annotated-types\n        # constraint metadata objects which describe it as fully as possible,\n        # and may include other unknown objects too.\n        if self.ge is not None:\n            yield Ge(self.ge)\n        if self.description is not None:\n            yield Description(self.description)\n```\n\nLibraries consuming annotated-types constraints should check for `GroupedMetadata` and unpack it by iterating over the object and treating the results as if they had been \"unpacked\" in the `Annotated` type.  The same logic should be applied to the [PEP 646 `Unpack` type](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/), so that `Annotated[T, Field(...)]`, `Annotated[T, Unpack[Field(...)]]` and `Annotated[T, *Field(...)]` are all treated consistently.\n\nLibraries consuming annotated-types should also ignore any metadata they do not recongize that came from unpacking a `GroupedMetadata`, just like they ignore unrecognized metadata in `Annotated` itself.\n\nOur own `annotated_types.Interval` class is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `Gt`, `Lt`, etc., so this is not an abstract concern.  Similarly, `annotated_types.Len` is a `GroupedMetadata` which unpacks itself into `MinLen` (optionally) and `MaxLen`.\n\n### Consuming metadata\n\nWe intend to not be prescriptive as to _how_ the metadata and constraints are used, but as an example of how one might parse constraints from types annotations see our [implementation in `test_main.py`](https://github.com/annotated-types/annotated-types/blob/f59cf6d1b5255a0fe359b93896759a180bec30ae/tests/test_main.py#L94-L103).\n\nIt is up to the implementer to determine how this metadata is used.\nYou could use the metadata for runtime type checking, for generating schemas or to generate example data, amongst other use cases.\n\n## Design & History\n\nThis package was designed at the PyCon 2022 sprints by the maintainers of Pydantic\nand Hypothesis, with the goal of making it as easy as possible for end-users to\nprovide more informative annotations for use by runtime libraries.\n\nIt is deliberately minimal, and following PEP-593 allows considerable downstream\ndiscretion in what (if anything!) they choose to support. Nonetheless, we expect\nthat staying simple and covering _only_ the most common use-cases will give users\nand maintainers the best experience we can. If you'd like more constraints for your\ntypes - follow our lead, by defining them and documenting them downstream!\n",

        "description": "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)\n=====================================================\n\nSupport for `Internationalized Domain Names in\nApplications (IDNA) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5891>`_\nand `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n<https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\nThe latest versions of these standards supplied here provide\nmore comprehensive language coverage and reduce the potential of\nallowing domains with known security vulnerabilities. This library\nis a suitable replacement for the “encodings.idna”\nmodule that comes with the Python standard library, but which\nonly supports an older superseded IDNA specification from 2003.\n\nBasic functions are simply executed:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis package is available for installation from PyPI via the\ntypical mechanisms, such as:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install idna\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor typical usage, the ``encode`` and ``decode`` functions will take a\ndomain name argument and perform a conversion to ASCII compatible encoding\n(known as A-labels), or to Unicode strings (known as U-labels)\nrespectively.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('ドメイン.テスト')\n    b'xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--eckwd4c7c.xn--zckzah'))\n    ドメイン.テスト\n\nConversions can be applied at a per-label basis using the ``ulabel`` or\n``alabel`` functions if necessary:\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> idna.alabel('测试')\n    b'xn--0zwm56d'\n\n\nCompatibility Mapping (UTS #46)\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis library provides support for `Unicode IDNA Compatibility\nProcessing <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_ which normalizes input from\ndifferent potential ways a user may input a domain prior to performing the IDNA\nconversion operations. This functionality, known as a \n`mapping <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5895>`_, is considered by the\nspecification to be a local user-interface issue distinct from IDNA\nconversion functionality.\n\nFor example, “Königsgäßchen” is not a permissible label as *LATIN\nCAPITAL LETTER K* is not allowed (nor are capital letters in general).\nUTS 46 will convert this into lower case prior to applying the IDNA\nconversion.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> import idna\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen')\n    ...\n    idna.core.InvalidCodepoint: Codepoint U+004B at position 1 of 'Königsgäßchen' not allowed\n    >>> idna.encode('Königsgäßchen', uts46=True)\n    b'xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'\n    >>> print(idna.decode('xn--knigsgchen-b4a3dun'))\n    königsgäßchen\n\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nAll errors raised during the conversion following the specification\nshould raise an exception derived from the ``idna.IDNAError`` base\nclass.\n\nMore specific exceptions that may be generated as ``idna.IDNABidiError``\nwhen the error reflects an illegal combination of left-to-right and\nright-to-left characters in a label; ``idna.InvalidCodepoint`` when\na specific codepoint is an illegal character in an IDN label (i.e.\nINVALID); and ``idna.InvalidCodepointContext`` when the codepoint is\nillegal based on its position in the string (i.e. it is CONTEXTO or CONTEXTJ\nbut the contextual requirements are not satisfied.)\n\nBuilding and Diagnostics\n------------------------\n\nThe IDNA and UTS 46 functionality relies upon pre-calculated lookup\ntables for performance. These tables are derived from computing against\neligibility criteria in the respective standards using the command-line\nscript ``tools/idna-data``.\n\nThis tool will fetch relevant codepoint data from the Unicode repository\nand perform the required calculations to identify eligibility. There are\nthree main modes:\n\n* ``idna-data make-libdata``. Generates ``idnadata.py`` and\n  ``uts46data.py``, the pre-calculated lookup tables used for IDNA and\n  UTS 46 conversions. Implementers who wish to track this library against\n  a different Unicode version may use this tool to manually generate a\n  different version of the ``idnadata.py`` and ``uts46data.py`` files.\n\n* ``idna-data make-table``. Generate a table of the IDNA disposition\n  (e.g. PVALID, CONTEXTJ, CONTEXTO) in the format found in Appendix\n  B.1 of RFC 5892 and the pre-computed tables published by `IANA\n  <https://www.iana.org/>`_.\n\n* ``idna-data U+0061``. Prints debugging output on the various\n  properties associated with an individual Unicode codepoint (in this\n  case, U+0061), that are used to assess the IDNA and UTS 46 status of a\n  codepoint. This is helpful in debugging or analysis.\n\nThe tool accepts a number of arguments, described using ``idna-data\n-h``. Most notably, the ``--version`` argument allows the specification\nof the version of Unicode to be used in computing the table data. For\nexample, ``idna-data --version 9.0.0 make-libdata`` will generate\nlibrary data against Unicode 9.0.0.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\n\n* **Packages**. The latest tagged release version is published in the\n  `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_.\n\n* **Version support**. This library supports Python 3.8 and higher.\n  As this library serves as a low-level toolkit for a variety of\n  applications, many of which strive for broad compatibility with older\n  Python versions, there is no rush to remove older interpreter support.\n  Support for older versions are likely to be removed from new releases\n  as automated tests can no longer easily be run, i.e. once the Python\n  version is officially end-of-life.\n\n* **Testing**. The library has a test suite based on each rule of the\n  IDNA specification, as well as tests that are provided as part of the\n  Unicode Technical Standard 46, `Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing\n  <https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/>`_.\n\n* **Emoji**. It is an occasional request to support emoji domains in\n  this library. Encoding of symbols like emoji is expressly prohibited by\n  the technical standard IDNA 2008 and emoji domains are broadly phased\n  out across the domain industry due to associated security risks. For\n  now, applications that need to support these non-compliant labels\n  may wish to consider trying the encode/decode operation in this library\n  first, and then falling back to using `encodings.idna`. See `the Github\n  project <https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18>`_ for more discussion.\n\n* **Transitional processing**. Unicode 16.0.0 removed transitional\n  processing so the `transitional` argument for the encode() method\n  no longer has any effect and will be removed at a later date.\n\n",

It can be installed as `python-slugify[unidecode]` for those who prefer it. `Unidecode` is believed to be more [advanced](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify/wiki/Python-Slugify-Wiki#notes-on-unidecode).\n\n### `Official` Support Matrix\n\n| Python         | Slugify            |\n| -------------- | ------------------ |\n| `>= 2.7 < 3.6` | `< 5.0.0`          |\n| `>= 3.6 < 3.7` | `>= 5.0.0 < 7.0.0` |\n| `>= 3.7`       | `>= 7.0.0`         |\n\n# How to install\n\n    easy_install python-slugify |OR| easy_install python-slugify[unidecode]\n    -- OR --\n    pip install python-slugify |OR| pip install python-slugify[unidecode]\n\n# Options\n\n```python\ndef slugify(\n    text: str,\n    entities: bool = True,\n    decimal: bool = True,\n    hexadecimal: bool = True,\n    max_length: int = 0,\n    word_boundary: bool = False,\n    separator: str = DEFAULT_SEPARATOR,\n    save_order: bool = False,\n    stopwords: Iterable[str] = (),\n    regex_pattern: str | None = None,\n    lowercase: bool = True,\n    replacements: Iterable[Iterable[str]] = (),\n    allow_unicode: bool = False,\n) -> str:\n  \"\"\"\n  Make a slug from the given text.\n  :param text (str): initial text\n  :param entities (bool): converts html entities to unicode (foo &amp; bar -> foo-bar)\n  :param decimal (bool): converts html decimal to unicode (&#381; -> Ž -> z)\n  :param hexadecimal (bool): converts html hexadecimal to unicode (&#x17D; -> Ž -> z)\n  :param max_length (int): output string length\n  :param word_boundary (bool): truncates to end of full words (length may be shorter than max_length)\n  :param save_order (bool): if parameter is True and max_length > 0 return whole words in the initial order\n  :param separator (str): separator between words\n  :param stopwords (iterable): words to discount\n  :param regex_pattern (str): regex pattern for disallowed characters\n  :param lowercase (bool): activate case sensitivity by setting it to False\n  :param replacements (iterable): list of replacement rules e.g. [['|', 'or'], ['%', 'percent']]\n  :param allow_unicode (bool): allow unicode characters\n  :return (str): slugify text\n  \"\"\"\n```\n\n# How to use\n\n```python\nfrom slugify import slugify\n\ntxt = \"This is a test ---\"\nr = slugify(txt)\nself.assertEqual(r, \"this-is-a-test\")\n\ntxt = '影師嗎'\nr = slugify(txt)\nself.assertEqual(r, \"ying-shi-ma\")\n\ntxt = '影師嗎'\nr = slugify(txt, allow_unicode=True)\nself.assertEqual(r, \"影師嗎\")\n\ntxt = 'C\\'est déjà l\\'été.'\nr = slugify(txt)\nself.assertEqual(r, \"c-est-deja-l-ete\")\n\ntxt = 'Nín hǎo.

Call it with `-h` for help.\n\nThe command can take its input directly on the command line or from STDIN (when the `--stdin` flag is passed):\n\n```\n$ echo \"Taking input from STDIN\" | slugify --stdin\ntaking-input-from-stdin\n```\n\n```\n$ slugify taking input from the command line\ntaking-input-from-the-command-line\n```\n\nPlease note that when a multi-valued option such as `--stopwords` or `--replacements` is passed, you need to use `--` as separator before you start with the input:\n\n```\n$ slugify --stopwords the in a hurry -- the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog in a hurry\nquick-brown-fox-jumps-over-lazy-dog\n```\n\n# Running the tests\n\nTo run the tests against the current environment:\n\n    python test.py\n\n# Contribution\n\nPlease read the ([wiki](https://github.com/un33k/python-slugify/wiki/Python-Slugify-Wiki)) page prior to raising any PRs.\n\n# License\n\nReleased under a ([MIT](LICENSE)) license.\n\n### Notes on GPL dependencies\nThough the dependencies may be GPL licensed, `python-slugify` itself is not considered a derivative work and will remain under the MIT license.  \nIf you wish to avoid installation of any GPL licensed packages, please note that the default dependency `text-unidecode` explicitly lets you choose to use the [Artistic License](https://opensource.org/license/artistic-perl-1-0-2/) instead.

Colorama makes this work on\nWindows, too, by wrapping ``stdout``, stripping ANSI sequences it finds (which\nwould appear as gobbledygook in the output), and converting them into the\nappropriate win32 calls to modify the state of the terminal. On other platforms,\nColorama does nothing.\n\nThis has the upshot of providing a simple cross-platform API for printing\ncolored terminal text from Python, and has the happy side-effect that existing\napplications or libraries which use ANSI sequences to produce colored output on\nLinux or Macs can now also work on Windows, simply by calling\n``colorama.just_fix_windows_console()`` (since v0.4.6) or ``colorama.init()``\n(all versions, but may have other side-effects – see below).\n\nAn alternative approach is to install ``ansi.sys`` on Windows machines, which\nprovides the same behaviour for all applications running in terminals. Colorama\nis intended for situations where that isn't easy (e.g., maybe your app doesn't\nhave an installer.)\n\nDemo scripts in the source code repository print some colored text using\nANSI sequences. Compare their output under Gnome-terminal's built in ANSI\nhandling, versus on Windows Command-Prompt using Colorama:\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/ubuntu-demo.png\n    :width: 661\n    :height: 357\n    :alt: ANSI sequences on Ubuntu under gnome-terminal.\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/tartley/colorama/raw/master/screenshots/windows-demo.png\n    :width: 668\n    :height: 325\n    :alt: Same ANSI sequences on Windows, using Colorama.\n\nThese screenshots show that, on Windows, Colorama does not support ANSI 'dim\ntext'; it looks the same as 'normal text'.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInitialisation\n..............\n\nIf the only thing you want from Colorama is to get ANSI escapes to work on\nWindows, then run:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\nIf you're on a recent version of Windows 10 or better, and your stdout/stderr\nare pointing to a Windows console, then this will flip the magic configuration\nswitch to enable Windows' built-in ANSI support.\n\nIf you're on an older version of Windows, and your stdout/stderr are pointing to\na Windows console, then this will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and/or ``sys.stderr`` in a\nmagic file object that intercepts ANSI escape sequences and issues the\nappropriate Win32 calls to emulate them.\n\nIn all other circumstances, it does nothing whatsoever. Basically the idea is\nthat this makes Windows act like Unix with respect to ANSI escape handling.\n\nIt's safe to call this function multiple times. It's safe to call this function\non non-Windows platforms, but it won't do anything. It's safe to call this\nfunction when one or both of your stdout/stderr are redirected to a file – it\nwon't do anything to those streams.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the older interface with more features (but also more\npotential footguns):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import init\n    init()\n\nThis does the same thing as ``just_fix_windows_console``, except for the\nfollowing differences:\n\n- It's not safe to call ``init`` multiple times; you can end up with multiple\n  layers of wrapping and broken ANSI support.\n\n- Colorama will apply a heuristic to guess whether stdout/stderr support ANSI,\n  and if it thinks they don't, then it will wrap ``sys.stdout`` and\n  ``sys.stderr`` in a magic file object that strips out ANSI escape sequences\n  before printing them. This happens on all platforms, and can be convenient if\n  you want to write your code to emit ANSI escape sequences unconditionally, and\n  let Colorama decide whether they should actually be output. But note that\n  Colorama's heuristic is not particularly clever.\n\n- ``init`` also accepts explicit keyword args to enable/disable various\n  functionality – see below.\n\nTo stop using Colorama before your program exits, simply call ``deinit()``.\nThis will restore ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to their original values, so that\nColorama is disabled. To resume using Colorama again, call ``reinit()``; it is\ncheaper than calling ``init()`` again (but does the same thing).\n\nMost users should depend on ``colorama >= 0.4.6``, and use\n``just_fix_windows_console``. The old ``init`` interface will be supported\nindefinitely for backwards compatibility, but we don't plan to fix any issues\nwith it, also for backwards compatibility.\n\nColored Output\n..............\n\nCross-platform printing of colored text can then be done using Colorama's\nconstant shorthand for ANSI escape sequences. These are deliberately\nrudimentary, see below.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import Fore, Back, Style\n    print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n    print(Back.GREEN + 'and with a green background')\n    print(Style.DIM + 'and in dim text')\n    print(Style.RESET_ALL)\n    print('back to normal now')\n\n...or simply by manually printing ANSI sequences from your own code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    print('\\033[31m' + 'some red text')\n    print('\\033[39m') # and reset to default color\n\n...or, Colorama can be used in conjunction with existing ANSI libraries\nsuch as the venerable `Termcolor <https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/>`_\nthe fabulous `Blessings <https://pypi.org/project/blessings/>`_,\nor the incredible `_Rich <https://pypi.org/project/rich/>`_.\n\nIf you wish Colorama's Fore, Back and Style constants were more capable,\nthen consider using one of the above highly capable libraries to generate\ncolors, etc, and use Colorama just for its primary purpose: to convert\nthose ANSI sequences to also work on Windows:\n\nSIMILARLY, do not send PRs adding the generation of new ANSI types to Colorama.\nWe are only interested in converting ANSI codes to win32 API calls, not\nshortcuts like the above to generate ANSI characters.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from colorama import just_fix_windows_console\n    from termcolor import colored\n\n    # use Colorama to make Termcolor work on Windows too\n    just_fix_windows_console()\n\n    # then use Termcolor for all colored text output\n    print(colored('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red'))\n\nAvailable formatting constants are::\n\n    Fore: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Back: BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, RESET.\n    Style: DIM, NORMAL, BRIGHT, RESET_ALL\n\n``Style.RESET_ALL`` resets foreground, background, and brightness. Colorama will\nperform this reset automatically on program exit.\n\nThese are fairly well supported, but not part of the standard::\n\n    Fore: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n    Back: LIGHTBLACK_EX, LIGHTRED_EX, LIGHTGREEN_EX, LIGHTYELLOW_EX, LIGHTBLUE_EX, LIGHTMAGENTA_EX, LIGHTCYAN_EX, LIGHTWHITE_EX\n\nCursor Positioning\n..................\n\nANSI codes to reposition the cursor are supported. See ``demos/demo06.py`` for\nan example of how to generate them.\n\nInit Keyword Args\n.................\n\n``init()`` accepts some ``**kwargs`` to override default behaviour.\n\ninit(autoreset=False):\n    If you find yourself repeatedly sending reset sequences to turn off color\n    changes at the end of every print, then ``init(autoreset=True)`` will\n    automate that:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from colorama import init\n        init(autoreset=True)\n        print(Fore.RED + 'some red text')\n        print('automatically back to default color again')\n\ninit(strip=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether ANSI codes should be\n    stripped from the output. The default behaviour is to strip if on Windows\n    or if output is redirected (not a tty).\n\ninit(convert=None):\n    Pass ``True`` or ``False`` to override whether to convert ANSI codes in the\n    output into win32 calls. The default behaviour is to convert if on Windows\n    and output is to a tty (terminal).\n\ninit(wrap=True):\n    On Windows, Colorama works by replacing ``sys.stdout`` and ``sys.stderr``\n    with proxy objects, which override the ``.write()`` method to do their work.\n    If this wrapping causes you problems, then this can be disabled by passing\n    ``init(wrap=False)``. The default behaviour is to wrap if ``autoreset`` or\n    ``strip`` or ``convert`` are True.\n\n    When wrapping is disabled, colored printing on non-Windows platforms will\n    continue to work as normal. To do cross-platform colored output, you can\n    use Colorama's ``AnsiToWin32`` proxy directly:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        import sys\n        from colorama import init, AnsiToWin32\n        init(wrap=False)\n        stream = AnsiToWin32(sys.stderr).stream\n\n        # Python 2\n        print >>stream, Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr'\n\n        # Python 3\n        print(Fore.BLUE + 'blue text on stderr', file=stream)\n\nRecognised ANSI Sequences\n.........................\n\nANSI sequences generally take the form::\n\n    ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>\n\nWhere ``<param>`` is an integer, and ``<command>`` is a single letter. Zero or\nmore params are passed to a ``<command>``. If no params are passed, it is\ngenerally synonymous with passing a single zero. No spaces exist in the\nsequence; they have been inserted here simply to read more easily.\n\nThe only ANSI sequences that Colorama converts into win32 calls are::\n\n    ESC [ 0 m       # reset all (colors and brightness)\n    ESC [ 1 m       # bright\n    ESC [ 2 m       # dim (looks same as normal brightness)\n    ESC [ 22 m      # normal brightness\n\n    # FOREGROUND:\n    ESC [ 30 m      # black\n    ESC [ 31 m      # red\n    ESC [ 32 m      # green\n    ESC [ 33 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 34 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 35 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 36 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 37 m      # white\n    ESC [ 39 m      # reset\n\n    # BACKGROUND\n    ESC [ 40 m      # black\n    ESC [ 41 m      # red\n    ESC [ 42 m      # green\n    ESC [ 43 m      # yellow\n    ESC [ 44 m      # blue\n    ESC [ 45 m      # magenta\n    ESC [ 46 m      # cyan\n    ESC [ 47 m      # white\n    ESC [ 49 m      # reset\n\n    # cursor positioning\n    ESC [ y;x H     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ y;x f     # position cursor at x across, y down\n    ESC [ n A       # move cursor n lines up\n    ESC [ n B       # move cursor n lines down\n    ESC [ n C       # move cursor n characters forward\n    ESC [ n D       # move cursor n characters backward\n\n    # clear the screen\n    ESC [ mode J    # clear the screen\n\n    # clear the line\n    ESC [ mode K    # clear the line\n\nMultiple numeric params to the ``'m'`` command can be combined into a single\nsequence::\n\n    ESC [ 36 ; 45 ; 1 m     # bright cyan text on magenta background\n\nAll other ANSI sequences of the form ``ESC [ <param> ; <param> ... <command>``\nare silently stripped from the output on Windows.\n\nAny other form of ANSI sequence, such as single-character codes or alternative\ninitial characters, are not recognised or stripped. It would be cool to add\nthem though. Let me know if it would be useful for you, via the Issues on\nGitHub.\n\nStatus & Known Problems\n-----------------------\n\nI've personally only tested it on Windows XP (CMD, Console2), Ubuntu\n(gnome-terminal, xterm), and OS X.\n\nSome valid ANSI sequences aren't recognised.\n\nIf you're hacking on the code, see `README-hacking.md`_. ESPECIALLY, see the\nexplanation there of why we do not want PRs that allow Colorama to generate new\ntypes of ANSI codes.\n\nSee outstanding issues and wish-list:\nhttps://github.com/tartley/colorama/issues\n\nIf anything doesn't work for you, or doesn't do what you expected or hoped for,\nI'd love to hear about it on that issues list, would be delighted by patches,\nand would be happy to grant commit access to anyone who submits a working patch\nor two.\n\n.. _README-hacking.md: README-hacking.md\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright Jonathan Hartley & Arnon Yaari, 2013-2020.

        "description": "\nISO 8601 date/time parser\n=========================\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/gweis/isodate.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/gweis/isodate\n    :alt: Travis-CI\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/gweis/isodate/badge.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/r/gweis/isodate?branch=master\n    :alt: Coveralls\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/isodate.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isodate/\n    :alt: Latest Version\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/isodate.svg\n    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isodate/\n    :alt: License\n\n\nThis module implements ISO 8601 date, time and duration parsing.\nThe implementation follows ISO8601:2004 standard, and implements only\ndate/time representations mentioned in the standard. If something is not\nmentioned there, then it is treated as non existent, and not as an allowed\noption.\n\nFor instance, ISO8601:2004 never mentions 2 digit years. So, it is not\nintended by this module to support 2 digit years. (while it may still\nbe valid as ISO date, because it is not explicitly forbidden.)\nAnother example is, when no time zone information is given for a time,\nthen it should be interpreted as local time, and not UTC.\n\nAs this module maps ISO 8601 dates/times to standard Python data types, like\n*date*, *time*, *datetime* and *timedelta*, it is not possible to convert\nall possible ISO 8601 dates/times. For instance, dates before 0001-01-01 are\nnot allowed by the Python *date* and *datetime* classes. Additionally\nfractional seconds are limited to microseconds. That means if the parser finds\nfor instance nanoseconds it will round it down to microseconds.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe following parsing methods are available.\n   * parse_time:\n        parses an ISO 8601 time string into a *time* object\n   * parse_date:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date string into a *date* object\n   * parse_datetime:\n        parses an ISO 8601 date-time string into a *datetime* object\n   * parse_duration:\n        parses an ISO 8601 duration string into a *timedelta* or *Duration*\n        object.\n   * parse_tzinfo:\n        parses the time zone info part of an ISO 8601 string into a\n        *tzinfo* object.\n\nAs ISO 8601 allows to define durations in years and months, and *timedelta*\ndoes not handle years and months, this module provides a *Duration* class,\nwhich can be used almost like a *timedelta* object (with some limitations).\nHowever, a *Duration* object can be converted into a *timedelta* object.\n\nThere are also ISO formatting methods for all supported data types. Each\n*xxx_isoformat* method accepts a format parameter. The default format is\nalways the ISO 8601 expanded format. This is the same format used by\n*datetime.isoformat*:\n\n    * time_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time strings with default format\n        *hh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * date_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-dd*.\n    * datetime_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO date-time strings with default format\n        *yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ*.\n    * duration_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO duration strings with default format\n        *PnnYnnMnnDTnnHnnMnnS*.\n    * tz_isoformat:\n        Intended to create ISO time zone strings with default format\n        *hh:mm*.\n    * strftime:\n        A re-implementation mostly compatible with Python's *strftime*, but\n        supports only those format strings, which can also be used for dates\n        prior 1900. This method also understands how to format *datetime* and\n        *Duration* instances.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThis module can easily be installed with Python standard installation methods.\n\nUse *pip install isodate*.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n   * The parser accepts several date/time representation which should be invalid\n     according to ISO 8601 standard.\n\n     1. for date and time together, this parser accepts a mixture of basic and extended format.\n        e.g. the date could be in basic format, while the time is accepted in extended format.\n        It also allows short dates and times in date-time strings.\n     2. For incomplete dates, the first day is chosen. e.g. 19th century results in a date of\n        1901-01-01.\n     3. negative *Duration* and *timedelta* value are not fully supported yet.\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\nThe doc strings and unit tests should provide rather detailed information about\nthe methods and their limitations.\n\nThe source release provides a *setup.py* script,\nwhich can be used to run the unit tests included.\n\nSource code is available at `<https://github.com/gweis/isodate>`_.\n\n\nCHANGES\n=======\n\n0.7.3 (unreleased)\n------------------\n\n- no changes yet\n\n\n0.7.2 (2024-10-08)\n------------------\n\n- drop end of life python versions\n- Don't match garbage characters at the end of parsed strings #16 (Gabriel de Perthuis)\n\n\nPotentially breaking changes:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- Fractional seconds are cut off to microseconds (always round down)\n- Allow control over return type of parse_duration #64 (Felix Claessen)\n- Python >= 3.7 required\n\n\n0.6.1 (2021-12-13)\n------------------\n\n- support python 3.10 (Hugo van Kemenade)\n- last version to support py 2.7\n\n\n0.6.0 (2017-10-13)\n------------------\n\n- support incomplete month date (Fabien Loffredo)\n- rely on duck typing when doing duration maths\n- support ':' as separator in fractional time zones (usrenmae)\n\n\n0.5.4 (2015-08-06)\n------------------\n\n- Fix parsing of Periods (Fabien Bochu)\n- Make Duration objects hashable (Geoffrey Fairchild)\n- Add multiplication to duration (Reinoud Elhorst)\n\n\n0.5.1 (2014-11-07)\n------------------\n\n- fixed pickling of Duration objects\n- raise ISO8601Error when there is no 'T' separator in datetime strings (Adrian Coveney)\n\n\n0.5.0 (2014-02-23)\n------------------\n\n- ISO8601Error are subclasses of ValueError now (Michael Hrivnak)\n- improve compatibility across various python variants and versions\n- raise exceptions when using fractional years and months in date\n  maths with durations\n- renamed method todatetime on Duraction objects to totimedelta\n\n\n0.4.9 (2012-10-30)\n------------------\n\n- support pickling FixedOffset instances\n- make sure parsed fractional seconds are in microseconds\n- add leading zeros when formattig microseconds (Jarom Loveridge)\n\n\n0.4.8 (2012-05-04)\n------------------\n\n- fixed incompatibility of unittests with python 2.5 and 2.6 (runs fine on 2.7\n  and 3.2)\n\n\n0.4.7 (2012-01-26)\n------------------\n\n- fixed tzinfo formatting (never pass None into tzinfo.utcoffset())\n\n\n0.4.6 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- added Python 3 compatibility via 2to3\n\n0.4.5 (2012-01-06)\n------------------\n\n- made setuptools dependency optional\n\n0.4.4 (2011-04-16)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed formatting of microseconds for datetime objects\n\n0.4.3 (2010-10-29)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed problem with %P formatting and fractions (supplied by David Brooks)\n\n0.4.2 (2010-10-28)\n------------------\n\n- Implemented unary - for Duration (supplied by David Brooks)\n- Output fractional seconds with '%P' format.
